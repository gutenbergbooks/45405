<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>


<p class="cap">Abner Pickett stood in the dusty
roadway, rake in hand, watching a load
of late August clover, that day harvested,
move slowly toward the barn. It was a rich,
fragrant, well-proportioned load, covering the
hay-rigging wholly from sight, hiding the horses
that drew it, swallowing in its luxurious depths
the man who drove the team. It was Abner
Pickett’s hay, and his team, and his barn; so
indeed were his all the fertile acres that surrounded
him. But for all this Abner Pickett
was not happy.</p>

<p>The yellow glow of the late afternoon sun
rested on his bronzed face, but it left there no
look of joy, nor even of content. He was a
picturesque figure as he stood facing the luminous
west. His long white hair, combed straight
back from his forehead, curled gracefully on his
broad shoulders. His complexion was as clear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
his cheeks as pink-tinted, his blue eyes as bright
and piercing, as though he had been seventeen
instead of sixty-five. His woollen shirt, open
winter and summer at the throat, disclosed a
muscular neck like a bronze column rising from
his chest, and revealed nowhere the wrinkles and
the hollows which betoken weight of years. His
manners and his moods were no less eccentric
than his looks. There were few people in that
region who had not, at one time or another, felt
the shock of his blunt speech or the keen edge
of his caustic tongue. Yet here and there some
one, usually some poor and friendless one, would
be found brave enough to face an incredulous
community and testify to Abner Pickett’s kindness
of heart. But he had the Pickett pride.
His father had it before him,&mdash;brought it with
him, indeed, when he came from New England
into Pennsylvania and purchased from the commonwealth
the four hundred acre tract on which
he built the Pickett homestead. Abner Pickett
inherited the place from his father. Not a square
foot of the four hundred acres had ever been sold.
It was his pride and his passion to keep it intact.
He intended to pass it down that way to his only
son Charlie. Not that he had any exalted idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of Charlie’s ability as a farmer. Indeed, it was
well known that Charlie did not take kindly to
farming. He was much more fond of knocking
around the country with the compass and surveyor’s
kit that he had managed to get together,
running land lines, locating corners, and laying
out village plots for the people of that section
of the country. And whether or not Abner
Pickett was liked by the neighbors, it is very
certain that his son Charlie was the most popular
young man in that end of Meredith County.
No one was surprised when he married the belle
of Port Lenox, the nearest up-river town, and
brought her to his father’s house. They all said
that a young man of his parts could have married
any one he chose. But every one was surprised
when it became generally known that the young
bride had found her way into Abner Pickett’s
well-guarded heart. People had been shaking
their heads ominously for a month, and predicted
all sorts of trouble and unhappiness for Charlie
Pickett’s wife in his father’s household. They
knew the old man’s eccentricities so well. Small
wonder, then, that they were astonished when
they awoke to the fact that Abner Pickett had
become the devoted slave of his daughter-in-law.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Nothing was too good for her. No service on
his part was too burdensome or too painstaking
if it added in the least to her comfort or pleasure.
Brusque and biting to the world about him, he
was to her as gentle and as helpful and as
courteous as a knight of old. During her long
illness after Dannie, his only grandchild, was born,
his devotion to her never ceased. And when he
saw the roses begin to come back into her cheeks,
he could no more restrain his delight than he
could refrain from drawing his breath. But one
night she grew suddenly ill again. And while
Charlie and Aunt Martha did for her all that
loving thought could suggest, or tender care
accomplish, Abner Pickett flung himself on his
brown mare and dashed madly off through the
darkness to Port Lenox, ten miles away, to fetch
the doctor. He had the doctor there by daylight;
but no physician, nor any drug, nor the most
loving care, could hold the struggling spirit in
the frail body, and two days later Charlie’s wife
was dead.</p>

<p>People who knew said that Abner Pickett felt
the blow as keenly as when his own wife died
twenty years before. He would not listen to the
suggestion that her body should be taken back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
her old home at Port Lenox for interment; and,
rather than face his wrath, her parents consented
that the burial should be made in the Pickett
family graveyard at the mouth of the gap. Their
action was fully justified.</p>

<p>That graveyard was the pride of Abner Pickett’s
heart. It lay in a direct line with the opening
into the gap, and barely two hundred feet
distant. On the north, it was bordered by the
public road, on the south, it was washed by the
rippling waters of the brook, and on every side,
save the west, the hills rose precipitously as if to
guard it. It was a beautiful half-acre. The
sward was always fresh and green, and flowers
bloomed there from May to October. Abner
Pickett’s parents were buried there, and his wife,
and his brother and sister, and his own children
who had died in infancy, as well as others more
distantly related to him. And the sheltering soil
also hid the bodies of some without home or
friends; bodies that, had it not been for Abner
Pickett’s generosity, would have found interment
in the potter’s field.</p>

<p>When Charlie’s wife was buried there, the old
man’s interest in his graveyard increased tenfold.
He bought the most beautiful monument that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the marble-cutters of Port Lenox could furnish,
and had it placed at the head of her grave. It
was a fluted column, with pedestal and cap,
draped with chiselled flowers. Looked at from
the west, it stood out, tall and graceful, outlined
in perfect proportion against the dark shadows of
the gap or the rich verdure of the hills that stood
like sentinels about it. That Abner Pickett’s
graveyard was dear to him, and that the memory
of Charlie’s wife was one of the tenderest spots in
his heart, no one who knew the old man ever
had reason to doubt.</p>

<p>But alas for Charlie! The life on the old
homestead, which had been irksome enough at
its best, grew suddenly unbearable. The ancient
farmhouse, lit up temporarily by the brightness
and sweetness of the young life so quickly and
pathetically ended, grew tenfold more dark and
forbidding than ever. It contained one jewel,
indeed, his baby, Dannie; but the child was not
yet old enough to cheer the father’s heart with
companionable ways, and the days dragged by in
ever increasing loneliness and sorrow. The tasks
of the farm, against the performance of which he
had always rebelled, became burdensome now beyond
endurance, and, on every possible pretext,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
he found his way, with compass and chain, outside
the borders of his father’s four hundred acres to
do work of which he grew more and more fond as
his knowledge and experience increased.</p>

<p>But all this was like gall and wormwood to his
father. If Abner Pickett had set his heart on
anything, it was that Charlie should follow in his
footsteps as manager and eventually owner of one
of the largest and best farms in Meredith County,
in which, like his father, he should take a just
and pardonable pride. That Charlie did not
develop a fondness for the farmer’s life was a sore
trial to the old man, but he hoped that, with
advancing years and larger wisdom, the boy,
grown to manhood, would yet take kindly to the
toil and triumphs of the farm. And when Charlie
settled down in the old homestead, with his
sweet young wife to cheer and encourage him, and
went out to the tasks of tillage with a hope and
vigor almost akin to zest for the work, the old
man felt that the fulness of the time for which he
had long hoped and waited was at last come.</p>

<p>But his satisfaction was short-lived. With the
death of Charlie’s wife it vanished. And when
the boy again took up his more congenial occupation,
and wandered off day after day with compass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and chain, leaving the farm to be cared for and
worked by others, the old man’s cup of sorrow
and bitterness was indeed full. Between him and
his son there had been no open rupture, but day
by day their relations with each other became
more strained, and each felt in the air the breath
of impending disaster.</p>

<p>It was early spring when Charlie’s wife died;
it was late August now. The summer, rich
in warmth and showers, yielding an abundance
from field and garden, vine and tree, had brought
to Abner Pickett only sorrow, disappointment,
and bitterness. All these were depicted in his
rugged face as he stood in the waning sunlight
and watched the creaking, jolting wagon with its
fragrant load move slowly to the barn.</p>

<p>Up the road from the direction of the gap came
Charlie, his compass on his arm, his tripod on his
shoulder, and his two-rod chain swinging loosely
from his free hand. He was a stalwart young
fellow, blue-eyed and fair-haired, tall and muscular,
bronzed with the sun and wind, vigorous with
the springing life of early manhood.</p>

<p>When Abner Pickett heard footsteps behind
him he turned and faced his son.</p>

<p>“Well, father, I’m back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Charlie had been in Jackson County for three
days tracing warrantee lines.</p>

<p>“Yes, I see,” replied the old man, the expression
of his face absolutely unchanged.</p>

<p>“Is Dannie well?”</p>

<p>“So far as I know.”</p>

<p>Charlie started on, but before he had gone a
dozen yards, he turned and came back to his
father.</p>

<p>“Father,” he said, “let’s end it.”</p>

<p>“End what?”</p>

<p>“This awkwardness, this uncertainty, this everlasting
disagreement about the farm. I can’t do
farm work, father, I’m not fitted for it&mdash;I hate
it.”</p>

<p>Charlie should have been less impulsive, more
considerate. To declare farm work hateful was,
in the mind of Abner Pickett, rank treason.
But Charlie was too much like his father to gloss
things over. He said what he felt, whether wise
or unwise.</p>

<p>Abner Pickett changed his rake from one hand
to the other, and still looked at the bulky load of
hay making its slow way to the dark and gaping
entrance to the barn.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said slowly and coldly; “that’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
been apparent for some time. There’s dogs
that’ll bite the hand that feeds ’em.”</p>

<p>Charlie’s face flushed.</p>

<p>“Don’t be unjust, father. I appreciate all
you’ve done for me. But I simply can’t stand it
on the farm&mdash;and I won’t.”</p>

<p>The old man was still impassive.</p>

<p>“No? Well, you’re of age. Your time’s
your own. There is no law to compel you to
work, exceptin’ the law of self-preservation. If
you choose to go gallivantin’ round the country
like old Hiram Posten, with a needle an’ a Jacob’s
staff, runnin’ out people’s back yards for ’em, it
ain’t nobody’s business but your own. But men
that stay on my farm must work on my farm.”</p>

<p>Charlie stood for a moment gazing at his father
intently.</p>

<p>“Does that mean,” he said at last, “that I
must give up my surveying or leave my home?”</p>

<p>The old man turned on his questioner suddenly,
aroused at last from his seeming impassiveness.</p>

<p>“Look here, young man,” he said, “I’ve got
the best four hundred acres o’ land in Meredith
County. After I’m through with it it’s yours
if you want it. But you can’t get it by runnin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
land lines in Jackson County all summer, an’
huntin’ muskrats in Beaver all winter. If you
want my farm, you’ve got to earn it, an’ the only
way you can earn it is to stay home an’ work it
like your father an’ your gran’father did before
you. Now, that’s the last word. Take it or
leave it as you choose.”</p>

<p>Charlie took no time for thought, no time to
counsel with himself. As quickly and decisively
as though he had been putting aside a toy he
replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Very well, father; I leave it.”</p>

<p>For one moment Abner Pickett stood aghast.
That any one, least of all his own son, whose
ancestral pride should have made such a thing
impossible, could throw away so coolly, so carelessly,
a gift like this, the condition of obtaining
which should have been a joy to him instead of a
burden&mdash;it was simply and wholly incomprehensible.
Without a word he turned on his heel and
started up the road toward the barn.</p>

<p>“Father!” called Charlie after him, “does this
mean that I must leave my home?”</p>

<p>The old man swung around and faced him
almost savagely.</p>

<p>“<em>Your</em> home!” he cried, “<em>your</em> home! Since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
when have you possessed it? Didn’t I get it
from my father as a reward of faithfulness?
Hasn’t my work an’ my money made it the best
place in Meredith County? Didn’t I bring you
up in it? Didn’t my money feed and clothe
you? Didn’t my money educate you an’ spoil
you in the best school in this end o’ the state?
Didn’t I cater to your whims an’ follies an’ laziness
for years at my own expense? An’ when
you saw fit to get married, and hadn’t a cent o’
your own to support a wife on, an’ wasn’t likely
to get it by your own exertions, didn’t I keep
you both under my own roof an’ save you from
starvation? An’ what have you ever done to
pay for it? An’ now you call it <em>your</em> home; an’
next you’ll be orderin’ me to vacate. I want you
to understand that this home, an’ this house, an’
this farm, an’ everything there is here is mine.
Do you hear? It’s mine, mine, mine!”</p>

<p>When Abner Pickett was angry, the blood
mounted slowly to his neck, then to his chin and
face, and finally suffused his forehead with its
glow. He was angry now; more angry than
Charlie had ever seen him before save once; and
that was when a man from Port Lenox offered
him a hundred dollars for a corner of his graveyard
on which to erect a cider mill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>And Charlie was angry in his turn. Up to
this moment he had been impatient and impulsive;
now, stung by unjust reproaches, the
hot blood of passion went surging through his
veins.</p>

<p>“You say what is not true!” he cried. “Since
I was eighteen I have earned enough and more
than enough to support myself and those dependent
on me. And in all that time I have
received from you only discouragement and ridicule,
and abuse and cruelty. I could stand it.
I had learned through years of suffering to stand
it. But when, in the presence of my wife, you
kept it up, she could not fathom you; it made
her heartsick and homesick and sorrowful, and in
the end it killed her! I say she could have conquered
disease, but her sympathy for me and her
fear of you, that killed her! Now I, too, have
said my last word. To-morrow I shall go. When
you can treat me justly I will come again, and
not till then.”</p>

<p>He turned on his heel, strode down the road,
past the graveyard, lifting his hat reverently as
he went by, and then was lost in the deepening
shadows of the glen.</p>

<p>Abner Pickett started homeward in a daze.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
His son’s terrible charge against him came upon
him like a stroke of lightning, and left him
blinded and bewildered.</p>

<p>“I killed her?” he murmured to himself. “I
killed her? I that loved her so; that would ’a’
cut off my right hand for her any day? What
does he mean? What Satan’s falsehood is it he
has given me?”</p>

<p>In the gray of the next morning Charlie Pickett
came up the path to his old home. The door
was unlocked. He opened it and entered. In
the sitting-room, with his head resting on his
hand, his face gray in the early morning light,
he found his father. He crossed the room and
stood before him.</p>

<p>“Father,” he said, “I lied to you yesterday.
I was unjust and unfilial. I have no excuse to
make except that I was moved by uncontrollable
anger. I do not know that you ever said a word
in the presence of my wife that could in any way
hurt her feelings. I do not know that you ever
caused her a single pain, a single regret, a single
sorrow. I do know that you were more than
kind to her, that you did for her everything that
loving thought or willing hands could do, and
that your grief at her death was scarcely less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
my own. I owe you this apology. I make it
now. For this offence I ask your forgiveness.
May I have it?”</p>

<p>The old man looked up at him impassively.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“But, father, it is the only lie I ever told you,
and I am sorry for it from the bottom of my
heart.”</p>

<p>“One lie is enough.”</p>

<p>“But I am going now. I may never see you
again. It is terrible for father and son to be thus
estranged. What can I do to redeem myself in
your eyes?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“May I come sometime to see you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Charlie turned toward the door, then, a thought
striking him suddenly, he turned back again.</p>

<p>“And Dannie, father?”</p>

<p>“Leave him with Martha.”</p>

<p>“Thank you! Good-by!”</p>

<p>The old man did not again respond. He still
sat with his forehead in his hands, motionless,
passionless, like granite. Charlie left the room,
closing the door behind him, and went upstairs.
In the hall he met Aunt Martha.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s all over, Auntie,” he said. “I’m going.”</p>

<p>The good woman had been weeping.</p>

<p>“I knew you had had it out with each other,
Charlie.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m not to return. I’m going to kiss
Dannie good-by. Father says I shall leave him
with you. Will you take him, Auntie?”</p>

<p>“Alice gave him to me to take care of when
she died, and I’ll keep him till you want him,
Charlie. But you’ll soon be coming back?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not, Auntie. I can’t tell you
about it. You know father. I was thoughtless
and cruel. He is firm and unforgiving. But
you’ll know where I am. When you want me
send for me, and I’ll come.”</p>

<p>He passed on into Dannie’s room. The child
was still sleeping. He bent down and kissed the
flushed cheek and the dimpled hand. A smile
crept over the little face, and the baby stirred in
his sleep. Then he went into his own room and
threw together a few things to supply his immediate
wants. When he went downstairs again,
Aunt Martha was standing in the front door.
She threw her arms around his neck and kissed
him good-by. She had known all his hopes, his
ambitions, his sorrows, his faults. She did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
side with him against his father, but she felt for
him from the bottom of her heart.</p>

<p>At the gateway he turned and threw back to
her a kiss. She stood in the front door and saw
his stalwart figure stride down the road through
the morning mist, and lose itself in the shadows
of the gap.</p>

<p>The summer passed, and autumn brought
tinted glory to Pickett’s Gap, and then winter
came and covered the landscape with her snows;
but Charlie Pickett did not come back. Years
went by, and still he did not return, and finally
his very name grew to be but a memory among
those who had known him in his boyhood and
his youth.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>


<p class="cap">“Good-by, Gran’pap!”</p>

<p>“Good-by, Dannie! Get to school in
time; and don’t forget to look after
the sheep.”</p>

<p>“All right, Gran’pap! Don’t forget about the
new suspenders.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed I won’t!”</p>

<p>“Good-by!”</p>

<p>Abner Pickett drove away, and Dannie sat on
the gate-post and watched him until a turn in the
road, as it wound through the narrow cañon of
Pickett’s Gap, shut him from sight.</p>

<p>He was still a picturesque figure, this old man,
as he faced the climbing sun and started on the
ten-mile journey to town. Approaching fourscore
years, he had lost little of his physical
energy, and none of his mental vigor. He was
still brusque and biting, exact to a hair’s-breadth,
honest to the heart. He never spoke to
any one of Charlie. The whole countryside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
knew that he had driven his son from his home;
but, save Charlie and himself, no one ever knew
the reason why. Abner Pickett would not talk
about it, and Charlie did not come back.</p>

<p>Not that the old man did not care. No one
believed that. No one could believe it who saw
him every day. Aunt Martha, than whom no one
knew him better, detected the bitterness and the
sorrow of the estrangement in his keen eyes, and
heard it in the tone of his voice time and again,
as he went about his accustomed tasks. But she
knew that in the stubbornness of his nature he
would suffer death before he would make the first
sign, or accept the first proffer of reconciliation.
His pride had been too deeply cut to be healed
with the salve of apology.</p>

<p>But then, there was Dannie. What Charlie had
lost of his father’s strange affection, Dannie had
won. And the fondness which the old man
had felt and shown for Dannie’s mother had been
transferred to her boy. But he was worthy of it.
He was bright and affectionate, a typical farmer’s
boy, the chum and crony of his grandfather.
Many a day they spent together in the woods
and fields, many a toothsome lunch they ate in
common. Many a trip they took to hunt small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
game, or whip the brooks for speckled trout.
Indeed, if you saw Abner Pickett anywhere within
the borders of his four hundred acre tract, you
might be pretty well assured that Dannie was not
far away.</p>

<p>When the boy was old enough to go to school,
it came hard for both of them to be separated all
day long; and no one but gran’pap knew what a
welcome sight it was to see the sturdy little figure
come tramping home along the dusty road from
the red schoolhouse two miles away.</p>

<p>So it was with a distinct feeling of loneliness
in the heart of each that the old man drove away
to town that bright September morning, and
Dannie, sitting on the gate-post, saw him go.</p>

<p>For a long time the boy sat there after the last
faint echo from the wheels of the rattling buckboard
died away, looking off toward the graveyard
with its fluted column, and on to the dim
recesses of the gap. He was wondering. He was
wishing. It was all about his father, whom he
never remembered to have seen, to whom he had
never spoken in his life, and yet who, so far as he
could learn, was living somewhere in estrangement
from his home. Why was it? When was
it? Whose fault was it? He had asked himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
these questions a thousand times. He had tried
to learn from others. It was in vain. He had
mentioned his father’s name once to gran’pap.
He never dared to do so the second time. He
was fond of his grandfather, very fond of him
indeed. The loveliness of his dead mother was a
tradition, not only at the Pickett hearthstone, but
in all the countryside. And yet, what this boy
wanted, what he longed for with his whole boy’s
heart, with all the ardor of his soul, was, not so
much a loving grandfather, not so much a dear
mother’s tenderness, as it was the living, breathing
presence and daily companionship of a strong
and stalwart father.</p>

<p>Ah, well! He dropped from his seat on the
gate-post, and strolled up the path to the farmhouse,
whistling softly. Max, the dog, came
bounding out to greet him, and, together, they
went out to the sheep pasture to see that the
sheep were not straying beyond bounds and tearing
their wool with the brambles. After that,
Aunt Martha, the housekeeper, gave him his dinner
in a pail, kissed him good-by as she always
did, and he started off to school. He had to
drive Max back. The dog was devoted to him
and always wanted to go with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>At the first bend in the road he turned to look
back, and saw Max still standing by the gate,
looking wistfully after his young master. Somehow
or other, although Dannie was fond of his
books, the day at school dragged dreadfully, and
it was with a long sigh of relief that he found
himself, in the afternoon, trudging down the
dusty road toward home. Max, waiting for him
at the gate, leaped joyfully out to meet him. He
went to the house to see Aunt Martha, and then
again, in compliance with gran’pap’s request, and
accompanied by the dog, he sauntered up to the
pasture to look after the sheep. That duty performed,
he went down to the flat and along the
road to the potato field where Gabriel, the steady
hired man, was digging potatoes. His name was
not Gabriel, as Dannie often explained; but every
one got to calling him that on account of his horn.
He had a big tin horn, once bright with red paint
and gilt bands, which he used for the purpose of
driving the cows, the sheep, the poultry, and any
other live-stock of which he might be in charge,
affecting to believe that the animals responded
more readily to his signals on the horn than they
would have done to the sound of his voice. He
was turning out beautiful, big, red potatoes; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Giant Rose he called them, with now and then a
few old-fashioned white pink-eyes in the hills.</p>

<p>“Great crop!” he exclaimed as Dannie came up.
“Biggest crop sence the year your pa went away.”</p>

<p>“What did my father go away for?” asked
Dannie, so quickly that Gabriel, startled by the
suddenness of the question, inadvertently struck
the blade of his hoe into a great plump potato
and split it from end to end.</p>

<p>“Oh, now, that’s too bad!” he exclaimed, as
he stooped to pick up the severed parts, moist
and milk-white on the broad cut surfaces.
“That’s the fust potater I’ve cut this season,
or even nicked,” he continued, gazing ruefully at
the vegetable wreck in his hand.</p>

<p>“What did my father go away for?” repeated
Dannie.</p>

<p>The question certainly was direct enough to
demand an answer. Gabriel leaned on his hoe-handle
thoughtfully, and took the matter into
due consideration before replying.</p>

<p>“Well now, I’ve hearn one story about it one
day, an’ another story about it another day.
Defferent people hez defferent idees. Ez fer
me, I ain’t prepared to make no affidavy about
it one way ner another. ‘Don’t tell what you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
don’t know jes’ because it’s easy,’ ez ol’ Isra’l
Pidgin use to say.”</p>

<p>“What do folks say he went away for?” persisted
Dannie.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s another question. Some says
one thing an’ some says another. Likely as not
they ain’t nobody knows jest the right of it.”</p>

<p>“Did he an’ Gran’pap quarrel?”</p>

<p>Gabriel pushed the loose dirt from the top
of the next hill of potatoes before he answered.</p>

<p>“Well, ef they did quarrel&mdash;now mind ye,
I ain’t a-sayin’ wuther they did or wuther they
didn’t&mdash;but ef they <em>did</em> quarrel, it was a quarrel
wuth lis’nin’ to, I can tell ye that. I knowed yer
pa; knowed ’im like a book; worked right alongside
of ’im many a day. Best-natered, best-hearted,
best-mannered young feller I ever see
in all <em>my</em> life. But”&mdash;impressively&mdash;“he
wouldn’t never let no one set on ’im. W’en
he sot out to do a thing he done it wuther or
no. An’ w’en he got ’is dander up&mdash;well, my
gracious! You seen he was a chip o’ the ol’
block then, sure. An’ yer gran’pap! Well, you
know yer gran’pap perty nigh as well as I do, an’
you know ’at w’at he ain’t capable uv in the way
o’ well-digested contrariness ain’t wuth mentionin’.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
’Member the dressin’ down he give
’Squire Biddlecomb las’ spring over that breechy
cow o’ his’n?”</p>

<p>Gabriel stopped for a moment to chuckle in
delighted remembrance over the incident to which
he had referred. Then he continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>“So, ez I say, ef they did quarrel, it must ’a’
be’n a rip-staver. An’, ez ol’ Isra’l Pidgin use to
say, ‘It takes longer fer a win’fall to grow up
with new timber ’an it does to heal up a family
quarrel.’”</p>

<p>Gabriel never tired of quoting Israel Pidgin;
but, when asked about this oracle, the facts he
was able to give were very meagre. “An ol’
feller I use to know up in York state” was
usually all the information that could be obtained.
There were those, however, who did not hesitate
to declare that the supposed sage was wholly a
creature of Gabriel’s imagination.</p>

<p>“Heard anything about the new railroad?”
he asked, changing the subject abruptly, and
digging violently into the bottom and sides of a
hill from which he had already thrown out all the
potatoes. “Say they’re a-comin’ right down
acrost the farm an’ out through the gap to the
river.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Dannie knew that it was useless to question
Gabriel further about his father, and he turned
away disappointed and vexed.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied impatiently, “I don’t know
anything about the new railroad, an’ I don’t
know as I care.”</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Gabriel, leaning contemplatively
on the handle of his hoe, “ef Abner
Pickett gits what it’s wuth to a railroad to run
through that gap, he can afford to wear a starched
shirt onct in a w’ile on a Sunday.”</p>

<p>“Gran’pap wears the kind o’ shirts that suits
him,” replied Dannie, indignantly, “an’ it’s
nobody’s business but his own.”</p>

<p>“Of course! Of course!” chuckled Gabriel.
“As ol’ Isra’l Pidgin use to say, ‘Blood’s
thicker’n water; an’ ye can’t thin it by stirrin’
of it up.’”</p>

<p>Dannie was tired and disheartened. He looked
away toward the gap and wished, with all his
heart, that he might see Gran’pap coming up the
road toward home. Some one, indeed, was coming
from out the shadows of the rocks, but it was
not Gran’pap. It was a small, black-whiskered
man, carrying an engineer’s transit. When he
was well out from the mouth of the gap he set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
up his instrument and adjusted it, and peered
through the telescope, first back into the shadows
of the cañon, and then ahead toward the graveyard,
into the sacred enclosure of which the flagman,
with his signal pole, was already advancing.</p>

<p>“Look, Gabriel!” exclaimed Dannie, “look!
What are they doing?”</p>

<p>Gabriel gave a quick glance toward the gap.</p>

<p>“It’s the new railroad,” he said. “Sure as
eternity, it’s the new railroad!”</p>

<p>The chainmen were now in sight, measuring off
the distances. The flagman, standing in the very
centre of the graveyard and looking back to the
transitman, was holding his pole on the ground
and balancing it with his hands to keep it plumb.</p>

<p>Gabriel had dropped his hoe, Dannie had
thrust his hands savagely into his trousers pockets,
and both stood gazing with wide eyes on the
animated scene.</p>

<p>“W’at under the canopy Abner Pickett’ll say
to that is more’n I’d like to wager on!” exclaimed
Gabriel. “Think of it, Dan! A railroad right
up through yer gran’pap’s gap; right up through
yer gran’pap’s road an’ crick; right up through&mdash;bust
my bellus ef ’tain’t a comin’ right up
through yer gran’pap’s graveyard!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Dannie set his teeth tight and jammed his fists
deeper into his trousers pockets as he saw an
engineer’s assistant drive a stake on the graveyard
eminence halfway between the fluted column and
the roadside wall. He had learned to hold the
burial plot in scarcely less reverence than did the
old man himself; and to see it trespassed on in
this fashion roused all his ire. But the trespass
was so audacious that, looking on it as he did, he
could neither move nor speak.</p>

<p>The engineers were evidently in some haste.
They were setting their line of stakes along the
narrow strip of land between the creek and the
public road. Already the leveller and the rodman
were in sight, following up the location, and the
transitman had advanced along the road to a point
opposite the potato field where the valley widened
and the land began to slope more gently to the
north and west. He leaped the fence lightly and
came to within twenty feet of where Dannie and
Gabriel were standing.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said Gabriel.</p>

<p>“Hello!” replied the stranger.</p>

<p>“Runnin’ a railroad?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Do you own the place?”</p>

<p>“No; but I work fer the man ’at does, an’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
I’m thinkin’ it wouldn’t be right healthy fer ye
ef he was in sight.”</p>

<p>The stranger laughed a little, showing a row of
very white teeth.</p>

<p>“Don’t he want a railroad through his place?”</p>

<p>“Not ef the court knows herself, he don’t, nor
through his gap nuther.”</p>

<p>“Does he own that gap?”</p>

<p>“Ain’t nobody else owned it fer forty year.”</p>

<p>The engineer looked back into the shadows
cast by the beetling cliffs, and then up along his
line of stakes.</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied, “all I have to say is,
speaking from a railroad point of view, he’s got a
valuable property.”</p>

<p>He glanced ahead at his flagman and directed
him to a point farther up in the field, to which
point, having fixed and recorded it, he himself
hastened, followed by Gabriel and Dannie. Up
to this moment the boy had not opened his
mouth. Now, with the ring of rising indignation
in his voice, he spoke up:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Has this railroad got a right to run through
my gran’father’s land without his permission?”</p>

<p>Either the engineer was in haste and did not
wish to be again interrupted, or else he did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
think the boy of sufficient consequence to demand
his attention; for, after looking him over for a
moment, he went on with his work without
replying.</p>

<p>Dannie repeated the question.</p>

<p>“I say has your railroad got a right to run
through my gran’father’s land if he don’t want it
to?”</p>

<p>The man evidently decided to reply.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said snappishly, “got a right to run
plumb through his house; and I’m not sure but
we shall if he does any kicking.”</p>

<p>“An’ have you got a right to run through that
graveyard down yonder?”</p>

<p>“Oh! graveyards don’t count when there’s a
railroad to be built. Come! you’re right in my
line of sight. Get over in the road there if you
want to see. Hadn’t you better run home, anyway,
and tell the old man to look out for his cattle?
First thing he knows the engine will be
a-puffing, and the bell a-ringing, and the whistle
a-blowing right through his barnyard, scaring all
his live-stock into fits.”</p>

<p>This was the last straw. It was bad enough
to drive a stake in his grandfather’s graveyard;
it was worse to order him out of his grandfather’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
field; but to ridicule, in that coarse way, the old
man whom he loved, that was the crowning insult.
Dannie’s face was white, and his hands, still tight
in his trousers pockets, were clenched in anger.</p>

<p>“<a href="#image02">This land is my gran’father’s, an’ I’ll stand
where I please on it</a>,” he declared. “An’ that
graveyard is my gran’father’s, an’ your railroad’ll
never lay a tie nor put a rail in it while Gran’pap
and I have breath in our bodies. An’ your
making fun of an old man like him when he ain’t
here is the act of a coward!”</p>

</div>

<p>The boy stopped, breathless, his breast heaving
and his eyes flashing. Gabriel, his face glowing
with exultation at the lad’s spirit, pulled his old
horn from his pocket, thrust it to his lips, and
gave a tremendous blast. The engineer stopped
in the middle of a record, looked the boy over
again from head to foot, and then burst into a
hearty laugh.</p>

<p>“You’ll do!” he exclaimed. “Stand right
where you are as long as you want to. If you
don’t own this farm some day, it won’t be because
you don’t deserve to. I’m through, anyway,” he
added, glancing at his watch. “Put a plug there,
John,” addressing an axeman, “and tell the boys
to chain up. The country beyond this is open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and free&mdash;room for fifty railroads; but the gap
is ours now, and the game is ours, and the Tidewater
and Western may catch us if it can. Put
a bench on the point of that rock, Miller, and
then get your tools together.”</p>

<p>The man addressed chiselled a cross on the projecting
crown of a huge rock near by, the leveller
took the height of the point and recorded it, and
the work of the day was done. The engineer
removed the head of his transit from the tripod,
and as the rest of the party faced toward the gap,
he turned to Dannie.</p>

<p>“Well, good night,” he said; “I don’t like
your manners, but I admire your spunk. Shall
we part friends?”</p>

<p>He held out his hand as he spoke, but Dannie
looked at him contemptuously and did not reply.</p>

<p>“Oh, just as you feel about it,” continued the
man. “But kindly give your aged and respected
grandparent this bit of advice from me, ‘Don’t
fight the Delaware Valley and Eastern.’”</p>

<p>He waved his hand jauntily, flung back another
unanswered “Good night,” and five minutes
later, with the rest of his company, he entered
into the dark recesses of the gap, on his way to
the river and the town.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>


<p class="cap">It was after dark before Abner Pickett came
home. Dannie had waited long for him at
the gate, his loneliness and anxiety increasing
as the minutes went by. He knew, from long
experience, what to expect when his grandfather
should learn about the railroad survey through
the gap and the graveyard. He sincerely hoped
that he would learn about it before he reached
home. Not that he, himself, stood in fear of his
grandfather, very far from that; but he dreaded
to be the bearer to him of evil tidings. Nevertheless
it was with a long sigh of relief that he
recognized the familiar sound of the rattling
buckboard as it came up out of the darkness to
his ears. Ten minutes later Abner Pickett drove
up to the gate.</p>

<p>“Hello, Gran’pap!”</p>

<p>“Hello, Dan! Out rather late, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>“Waitin’ for you, Gran’pap.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m here, an’ glad to get here. How’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
things go to-day? Gabriel get the potatoes all
out? Have a good time at school, Dan?”</p>

<p>It was evident that he had not heard about the
railroad, or he certainly would not have been in
this cheerful frame of mind. After mature deliberation
Dannie decided that it would not be
advisable to break the news to him until after he
had eaten his supper.</p>

<p>Gabriel came out to help carry the parcels into
the house and put away the team.</p>

<p>“I got the suspenders for you, Dan&mdash;red in
the middle, with sky-blue edges an’ pink posies
on the end. How does that strike you, eh?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Gran’pap. They’re very nice,
I’m sure.”</p>

<p>They all went out to the barn with the team.
Abner Pickett liked to see, for himself, that his
horses were well taken care of. He seldom came
from town in a more cheerful mood than that
which possessed him to-night. Everything had
gone his way during the day, and that fact was
clearly reflected in his manner and conversation.
When he went into the feed-room after the oats,
taking the lantern with him, Gabriel took the
opportunity to pull Dannie’s sleeve, and ask in
a ghostly whisper:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ain’t heerd about it, has ’e?”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose not.”</p>

<p>“Who’s a-goin’ to tell ’im?”</p>

<p>“Can’t you?”</p>

<p>“Not on your life! Wouldn’t do it fer the
hull farm&mdash;live-stock throwed in. He’d light
onto me like a thousan’ o’ brick. ‘Discretion is
the better part o’ valor when theys a job to lose,’
ez ol’ Isra’l Pidgin use to say.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I suppose I’ll have to. Thought
I’d wait till after he’s had his supper. Wouldn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Great scheme! ‘A full stummick is twin
brother to a big heart,’ ez ol’ Isra’l&mdash;’sh!
’sh!”</p>

<p>Abner Pickett came back from the feed-room
with a measure brimming full with oats, and
divided the grain carefully between the two
horses, talking in the meantime in the most
cheerful manner of the work on the farm, and of
the incidents of his trip to town.</p>

<p>When the task at the barn was finished, they
all went back to the house, and the old man sat
down alone to the supper saved for him by Aunt
Martha. Afterward he joined Dannie and Gabriel
on the side porch. The smoke from his pipe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
curled up through the warm, still air, and floated
about among the rafters of the ceiling.</p>

<p>“Ain’t it about time you went to bed, Dannie?”
he asked gently, lifting his feet to a resting-place
on the porch railing.</p>

<p>“I thought I’d stay up a bit yet, Gran’pap;
it’s so warm an’ pleasant to-night.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t mind if you do.”</p>

<p>After that there was silence for a time. Then
there was the sound of a footstep on the walk,
and a man came up out of the darkness. It was
David Brown, the next neighbor to the west.</p>

<p>“Heard you were down to the river to-day,
Mr. Pickett,” he said. “Wanted to see you a
minute. Thought I wouldn’t disturb you till
after you’d had your supper.”</p>

<p>“Just finished. Glad to see you. Come up
on the stoop, David, and have a chair.”</p>

<p>Mr. Brown accepted the invitation very willingly.</p>

<p>“Thought I’d run down for a minute,” he
continued, “and ask about the new railroad.
Thought maybe you might ’a’ heard something
about it down to the river.”</p>

<p>“What new railroad, David?”</p>

<p>“Why, the Delaware Valley and Eastern, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
believe they call it. I noticed they were pointing
pretty straight for my place when they quit
to-night.”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite understand. Has there been
more talk about railroads?”</p>

<p>Mr. Brown turned to Dannie.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you told your grandfather about it
yet?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” stammered Dannie. “I&mdash;I was
just going to when you came.”</p>

<p>Gabriel left the chair in which he was sitting
next his employer, and went down and seated
himself on the porch steps. Abner Pickett took
his pipe from his mouth, and, grasping it
firmly in the fingers of his right hand, looked
questioningly from one member of the group
to another.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said at last, “why don’t somebody
speak? Are you all struck dumb? What is it
about the railroad, Dannie?”</p>

<p>“Why, Gran’pap, they&mdash;the surveyors you
know&mdash;they&mdash;they&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Whacked their stakes in regardless&mdash;” broke
in Gabriel, in his intense anxiety to help Dannie
out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Abner Pickett turned on him savagely:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Shut up, you fool!” he commanded. “Go
on, Dannie.”</p>

<p>“Well, they ran a railroad line up through the
gap an’ stopped at the upper end of the potato
lot.”</p>

<p>It was out at last, much to Dannie’s relief.
When Abner Pickett spoke again, his voice was
as quiet and steady as though he were discussing
nothing of greater moment than crops or cattle.</p>

<p>“Do it to-day, did they?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Dannie, “to-day.”</p>

<p>“Set their stakes?”</p>

<p>“Yes, set their stakes.”</p>

<p>“Anything done to prevent ’em?”</p>

<p>“Why, no. I couldn’t do anything. I told
’em that they would never build their railroad,
though.”</p>

<p>“Laughed at you, didn’t they?”</p>

<p>Dannie’s cheeks flushed with mortification and
anger as he recalled his interview with the
engineer.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, they did; but I told ’em&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No matter what you told ’em; was anything
done?”</p>

<p>The rising inflection in the old man’s voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
warned his hearers that he was no longer able
to smother the fires of anger kindled in his
breast.</p>

<p>“Nothing, Gran’pap. There were seven of
them.”</p>

<p>Again, in his anxiety to come to Dannie’s assistance,
Gabriel broke in:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I told ’em that ef Abner Pickett was there,
he&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Shut up, you fool!”</p>

<p>Gabriel obeyed his employer’s command without
a word of comment. The silence which followed
was broken by David Brown.</p>

<p>“Just thought I’d come over, Mr. Pickett,
and inquire. Didn’t know but maybe you might
know what they were paying for right of way.”</p>

<p>The old man straightened himself in his
chair.</p>

<p>“Right o’ way!” he exclaimed scornfully;
“right o’ way! They don’t pay for it; they
steal it. They pick out the best land you’ve
got, set their stakes on it, an’ call it theirs.
They’re thieves an’ robbers, an’ cowards as well.
Yes, cowards! Else why did they wait all summer
to pick out a day when I was away from
home an’ nobody on the premises but a thirteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
year old boy an’ a blamed fool of a hired man.
Oh! if I’d ’a’ been here, I’d ’a’ told ’em where to
set their stakes!”</p>

<p>He rose to his full six feet two inches, straight
as a pine tree, his neck and face crimson with
anger, his blue eyes flashing fire. Neighbor
Brown arose and moved awkwardly down the
steps.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll have to be going, Mr. Pickett,” he
said. “Thought I’d just run over an’ see&mdash;an’
see if there was any news from the river.”</p>

<p>But Abner Pickett had a parting shot to fire.</p>

<p>“Mind what I tell you, David Brown. If
they’re a-pointing toward your place, the only
way to protect your rights is to set on your line
fence with a shot-gun in your hands. The law
won’t help you, an’ compensation for the right
o’ way is nothin’ more nor less than an insult.
There’s my advice to you. Take it, or let it
alone, as you like.”</p>

<p>After David Brown had gone, the old man grew
somewhat calmer. He took two or three turns
up and down the porch, and then resumed his
seat.</p>

<p>“Strike into the potato field, did they?” he
asked of Dannie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply; “went up through the
west end of it, far as the big rock.”</p>

<p>“Where else did they go?”</p>

<p>“Why, they cut across the corner of the
meadow lot, an’ below that they run through&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Through&mdash;oh, Gran’pap!”</p>

<p>The old man rose slowly to his feet again, as
if impelled thereto by a dreadful thought.</p>

<p>“Dannie&mdash;the graveyard?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Gran’pap.”</p>

<p>The clay pipe which Abner Pickett had been
smoking broke into a dozen pieces beneath the
pressure of his clenched hand, and fell rattling
to the floor. It was a full minute before he
asked the next question.</p>

<p>“Dannie, how near&mdash;how near the grave?”</p>

<p>“Halfway between it and the road, Gran’pap.”</p>

<p>They were all three standing now; and Aunt
Martha, attracted by the unusual sound of their
voices, had come to see if anything was wrong,
and stood listening in the doorway. The old
man spoke slowly, but with terrible emphasis.</p>

<p>“It is sacrilege. It is not only ignoring the
rights o’ the living, it is violating the rights o’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the dead. <a href="#image03">No better deed could be done by
any one than to pull their accursed stakes from
the ground and fling ’em, one and all, into the
water of the brook!</a>”</p>

</div>

<p>He walked slowly across the porch and into
the house; but before he had gone half-way
through the kitchen he turned and came back
to the door.</p>

<p>“Dannie,” he asked, “what kind of a lookin’
man was the engineer?”</p>

<p>“A short man, Gran’pap, with black eyes an’
hair.”</p>

<p>The old man gave a sigh of relief, but he was
not yet quite satisfied.</p>

<p>“Was there only one of ’em?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Why, there was another engineer at the other
instrument.”</p>

<p>“An’ how did he look?”</p>

<p>“Oh! he was tall an’ had red cheeks an’ blue
eyes an’ light hair, hadn’t he, Gabriel?”</p>

<p>“Gabriel, who was it? Speak!”</p>

<p>Abner Pickett had turned upon Gabriel and
made his demand so abruptly, so savagely, that
the man was almost too frightened to reply.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why&mdash;” he stammered.</p>

<p>“Well, speak! speak! speak!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, I don’t rightly know, Mr. Pickett. I
wa’n’t payin’ no attention to that one. I was
lookin’ at the other one; the little one with black
whiskers, the smart one, the&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you see the other one at all? Don’t
you know who it was? Hadn’t you ever seen ’im
before? Speak!”</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Pickett, as I was tellin’ ye, I
didn’t pay no partic’ler attention to that one. I
was&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You fool!”</p>

<p>The old man loosed his grip on the handle of
the door, strode across the kitchen, and disappeared
into the shadows of his own bedroom.
After that, for many minutes, there was silence
between Dannie and Gabriel. The hired man
was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“Well, as ol’ Isra’l Pidgin use to say, ‘Betwixt
the fool an’ the philosopher, the fool’s the happiest.’
I shan’t lose no sleep to-night; he will.
Come, Dannie, it’s high time fer both of us to
foller his example an’ turn in.”</p>

<p>As he finished speaking, he passed through the
open door, across the kitchen, and up the steep
staircase to his own room.</p>

<p>Then Aunt Martha came out to where Dannie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
still stood on the porch, and laid her hand
lovingly on his head.</p>

<p>“Gabriel’s right,” she said, “it’s time you were
in bed.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know; but isn’t it terrible, Aunt
Martha?”</p>

<p>“It’s unfortunate, Dannie. But he had to
know it; and the sooner, the better. You know
how he is; and he’ll be partly over it by morning.
But he’s very good to you, Dannie, very
good.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Aunt Martha, he is. My father couldn’t
have been better to me. Where is my father,
Aunt Martha?”</p>

<p>She was not his aunt. He had no aunt, nor
uncle either, for that matter. But she had taken
him in her arms when his mother died, and she had
nursed him in sickness, and fed him in health, and
cared for him constantly; and she was just as
proud of this rugged and manly boy as ever his
own mother could have been. She could have
answered the boy’s question. She and she only
could have given him the information he desired.
For, through all the years, she had kept in touch
with Charlie Pickett. She had written letters to
him at midnight, and mailed them secretly, telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
him of his child’s health and growth and prosperity.
But she did not dare to tell this boy
what she knew; she dared only to tell him what
she hoped.</p>

<p>“He’s somewhere in the wide world, dearie.
Sometime, I hope, he’ll come back to us.”</p>

<p>And yet she felt, in her heart, that her “sometime”
would not be until Abner Pickett’s tongue
was forever still.</p>

<p>“Why did he go away? Was Gran’pap unkind
to him? Tell me that, Aunt Martha.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! I can’t tell you that. I can’t set
myself up as a judge between those two. But
it’ll all come out right in the end, Dannie; I’m
sure of that; it always does. It’s for you and me
to do just the very best we can, and not worry
ourselves about things we can’t help. Try to do
that, Dannie. You’re a brave boy, and I’m
proud of you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Aunt Martha!”</p>

<p>Again the boy’s attempt to learn something
about his father had been foiled, as it had been
so often before. He sank down into the porch
chair despairingly, and leaned his head on his
hand. The full moon, riding gloriously in the
eastern sky, shone upon his face and revealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the tears upon his cheeks. In spite of the good
woman’s counsel he could not yet repress the
longing of his heart.</p>

<p>“I want him so, Aunt Martha!” he exclaimed.
“I want him so! If he was dead, as my mother
is, I’d never think of it. But somewhere he’s
living, and I can’t get to him, and he won’t come
to me, and no one will tell me why, and there’s
such a mystery about it all. Oh, I can’t understand
it!”</p>

<p>Aunt Martha dropped to her knees beside his
chair and drew his head down to her shoulder.</p>

<p>“There, there!” she said soothingly, “never
mind! It’ll all end happily, I know. You’re
tired to-night, and it’s very late. Come, go to
bed now, that’s a good boy. Things’ll look
brighter in the morning.”</p>

<p>So, with gentle words, she led him to his room,
gave him a tender good-night, and then went
about her duties, one of those sweet souls that
love to smooth out the hard places on life’s pathway
for the tender feet of others. Thank Heaven
that they live!</p>

<p>Dannie went to bed, but not to sleep. He
could not forget his grandfather’s mighty anger;
and the old man’s declaration, made with such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
terrible emphasis, kept ringing in his ears, “No
better deed could be done by any one than to pull
their accursed stakes from the ground and fling
’em, one and all, into the water of the brook.”</p>

<p>After a while he rose and looked out of the
window. The country was flooded with moonlight.
The woods and fields were bathed in it.
The willows that marked the sinuous course of
the brook were transformed into shivering masses
of silver. The public road, leading to the west,
wound, luminously gray, through the meadow
and under the trees. Black, in the shadowed
face of the ridge, lay the mouth of the gap, and
white and clear-cut against it shone out the
marble column that marked the sacred grave.
Dannie imagined that he could almost see the
line of stakes set by the engineers, starting at the
big rock in the potato field, cutting down by
the corner of the meadow, across the road,
through the graveyard, and into the gap. He
wondered how long it would be before the railroad
would be built, before the trains would be
rolling by, before the greensward of the burial
place would be cut and slashed and torn by the
picks and spades of workmen, before the graves
themselves would tremble and shrink beneath the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
strain and stress of ponderous engines and thundering
trains. The thing was too dreadful to
contemplate. And again, more clear, more distinct,
more impressive than ever, the words of
Abner Pickett rang through his mind, “No better
deed could be done by any one than to pull their
accursed stakes from the ground and fling ’em,
one and all, into the water of the brook.”</p>

<p>Then there came into his mind a thought that,
all in a moment, set his heart throbbing tumultuously,
and his breast heaving with excitement.
Well, why not? Abner Pickett had declared
that no better deed could be done by any one.
If that were true, was not Abner Pickett’s grandson
the one to do it? And if it were to be
done, could there be a more favorable time in
which to do it than this glorious moonlight
night? If, when the morning dawned, those
hated stakes had disappeared, would not Abner
Pickett be again in possession of every right in
his own land, with the power to keep it; and
would not the insult to the dead be properly
avenged?</p>

<p>The more Dannie thought of the scheme, the
more firmly it took possession of his mind, the
more thoroughly he became convinced that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
was right and just for him to carry out the desire
so forcibly expressed by his grandfather. From
the very nature of the enterprise it was apparent
to him that he could take no one into his confidence.
Whatever was done must be done by
him alone. And there was no time to lose. He
began, mechanically, to put on his clothes, and
finished the task in nervous haste. He crept
down the stairs in his stocking feet, with his shoes
in his hand, found his cap, slid back the bolt on
the hall door, and passed out on the front porch.
Max, the dog, came from the woodhouse, barking
softly, and, leaping up on him, tried to lick his
face.</p>

<p>“Down, old fellow, down! No, you can’t go.
Back to your box; back!”</p>

<p>He led the way back to the woodhouse,
ordered the dog to his bed again, found his own
hatchet, and then passed hurriedly down the path
to the gate. Once in the road, he began to run,
and did not stop till he had reached the fence
marking the western limit of the potato field.
He climbed hastily over and began to hunt for
the last stake set by the surveyors. When he
found it he loosened it with two blows of his
hatchet, pulled it from the ground, and started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
back to find the next one. This also he
removed, and kept on down the line, treating all
stakes in his course in the same way. When he
crossed the road and came to the border of the
brook he threw his armful of stakes into the
water and, standing there triumphantly, he saw
them float away. Then he climbed over the
stone wall and entered the graveyard. He found
the stake set in the centre of the plot, pulled it
from its fastening in the greensward, and flung it
gleefully after the others. He felt that he had
now given this cherished half-acre again wholly
into the possession of his grandfather, and that
he had, so far as in him lay, avenged the insult to
the dead.</p>

<p>But he did not stop here. He had no
thought of doing so. He was flushed with his
triumph, and the spirit of destruction was aflame
in his breast. Following down the line of survey,
he drew stake after stake from the yielding
soil, and consigned them all to the mercy of the
stream. Already he had entered the gap. The
full moon that shone down between the precipitous
walls of the gorge made the road that wound
along the base of the northerly cliff almost as
light as day. For half a mile there was scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
room for the road and the brook to pass through,
so narrow was the space between the towering
heights on either side. Some of the stakes indeed
were set in the bed of the stream, while others
encroached on the travelled track of the highway.
Some of them, in the shadow of rock or tree or
bush, Dannie had to search to find. But not one
escaped his vigilance&mdash;not one. And when, at
last, he emerged from the gap and came out on
the eastern face of the ridge that flanked the
Delaware, he had not left a mark or a monument
behind him to indicate that a corps of engineers
had ever passed that way.</p>

<p>Here the road forks; one branch going to the
north and reaching Port Lenox, the up-river town,
the other descending rapidly to the village of
Fisher’s Eddy on the south. But the brook,
unchecked, goes straight on, down the rugged
hillside, churned into foam, dashed into spray,
leaping from rock to rock, losing itself at last in
the slow-moving flood of the Delaware. Dannie
stood for a moment looking out over the broad
valley and the shining river, and down at the few
twinkling lights of the village to the south. Then
he turned again to his yet uncompleted task.
The line of survey followed the public road to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
north, keeping somewhat above it in its descent,
and for nearly half a mile farther the boy had no
trouble in finding the stakes, tearing them from
their beds and flinging them down the steep declivity
into the tangle of rocks and brushwood
below. When he had gone to the limit of his
grandfather’s land, he stopped and turned back.
He was tired. He did not know how late it
might be. He felt that he must hurry home.
So he hastened up the road, along the easterly
face of the hillside now falling into shadow, and
entered the mouth of the gorge. Between the
great rock faces, now bright in the moonlight,
now dark in the shade, he trudged wearily. When
he was halfway through the glen, he heard the
sound of voices ahead of him. He stood still
and listened. Men were talking in subdued
tones. There was a splash in the water, the
crackling of dry brush, the tapping of wood as
though some one were driving stakes, the clinking
of steel as though a chain were being dragged
along the ground. Then, from behind a projecting
ledge, a man advanced into the moonlight,
and, before Dannie, in his surprise and fear, could
either speak or run, the light of a lantern was
flashed into his face.</p>

<p class="cap">“Who are you?” demanded the man
with the lantern, “and what are you
doing here at this time o’ night?”</p>

<p>Dannie was too much frightened to answer at
once, and he began to back away.</p>

<p>“Stand still!” commanded the man. “No
one’s going to hurt you. I simply want to know
who you are and where you are going.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’m going home,” faltered Dannie.</p>

<p>A voice came from out the shadows up the road.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter down there, John?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied John. “Here’s a
boy with a hatchet, alone. Looks suspicious,
very.”</p>

<p>“Tell him to stay where he is till I get there.
Go ahead now and give me a point to turn on.”</p>

<p>“You hear him?” said John to Dannie. “You
stand right there by that rock, and don’t you move
an inch till he comes up.”</p>

<p>The man with the lantern had an engineer’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
signal pole. He was followed by an axeman with
stakes. They went ahead some fifty feet, and,
with pole and lantern, under the direction of the
transitman back in the darkness, located a point
and drove a stake.</p>

<p>It did not take Dannie long to comprehend that
this was another surveying party, making a night
survey through the gap. It was a strange thing
to do&mdash;very strange. He could not understand
the purpose of it at all. Did these people know
of the afternoon survey? Did they know of his
night work of destruction? And if they did,
would they make him suffer for it? The situation
was as uncomfortable for Dannie as it was
mysterious. But he had scant time to revolve
these questions in his mind before the transitman
and his attendant came hurrying down to where
the boy was standing.</p>

<p>A tall, fine-looking fellow this transitman was;
but the moonlight, or possibly excitement or
fatigue, threw a pallor across his face, and in his
penetrating eyes there was a look of anxiety or
trouble.</p>

<p>“How is this, my boy?” he said. “What are
you doing here? Tell me quickly. I haven’t
time to parley.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>But Dannie had no mind to give him the
desired information.</p>

<p>He had grown suddenly fearful of the consequences
of his deed of destruction. He was not
untruthful about it, though.</p>

<p>“I had rather not tell you, sir,” he replied
frankly.</p>

<p>“Very well, I shall not oblige you to,” said
the man. “But, under these circumstances, I
will have to detain you. Morris,” addressing the
head chainman, “keep this boy with you. Don’t
let him give any signals, and don’t let him escape.
We’ll dispose of him later. Too much depends
on this night’s work to take any risks with
strangers. Come along, James!”</p>

<p>He shouldered his transit, and, followed by his
attendant, started rapidly ahead. Dannie, under
the eye of the head chainman, walked on down
the road. The axemen had already gone forward
to clear the way, and the rodman and leveller
were following close behind.</p>

<p>It was a unique task, this location of a railroad
route in the night-time. But, aided by the bright
moonlight and the glare of lamps for signals, it
became not only possible of performance, but
perfectly practicable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Slowly the line of stakes stretched out, following,
with almost minute exactness, the route
surveyed in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Indeed, there was room in the gap but for one
railroad, and the second survey had, of necessity,
to take practically the same course as the
first.</p>

<p>As Dannie walked along in the company of
the head chainman, it became apparent to him
that these men did not know of the survey made
by the corps of engineers in the afternoon; much
less did they know of his work of obliteration.
The serious results of that work began also to
weigh more deeply on him. A hundred questions
arose in his mind. If the line of stakes set
in the afternoon were still standing, would these
men be here setting theirs to-night? And when
they learned that a prior survey had been made,
what would they do? And if any one should
ever know that he, Dannie Pickett, had destroyed
that line of stakes, what would happen then to
him? And of what avail was it, anyway, to wipe
out the marks of one location only to have the
stakes of another spring up in their places scarcely
an hour later? But with all his questioning he
could decide upon but one thing, and that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
that under any circumstances he must keep his
own counsel and reveal nothing.</p>

<p>At last the end of the gap was reached, but the
railroad route was located for yet another thousand
feet down the north slope of the hill.</p>

<p>“There is plenty of room here,” said the
transitman, finally; “there is no object in going
farther to-night. We’re safely through the gap.
We’re first through the gap, and the gap route is
ours by right of prior location.”</p>

<p>Dannie recalled the exultant declaration, made
under similar circumstances, by the engineer who
conducted the afternoon survey. Surely the plot
was thickening.</p>

<p>“You might step down the road a bit, John,”
added the transitman, “while we are getting the
things together here, and see if you can find any
trace of the D. V. and E. people. Nicholson
should have ended his survey somewhere near
here last evening if he had good luck.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later John returned and reported
that he had found the D. V. and E. stakes
about three hundred feet farther down the road,
where the party had evidently stopped for the
night.</p>

<p>The transitman laughed softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should like to be behind a tree or a rock,”
he said, “and see Nicholson when he comes here
after daylight to continue his survey and finds his
proposed gap route already taken.”</p>

<p>Ever more deeply as he listened, Dannie
appreciated the difficulties in which he had involved
the railroad companies, and the dangers
into which he himself had plunged. One thing
only he was sure of, and that was that his mouth
must remain closed.</p>

<p>When everything was ready they all started
back, at a good pace, up the hill and into the glen.</p>

<p>“Here, my boy,” said the transitman, “come
with me. I want to talk with you.”</p>

<p>Dannie fell back and walked with him. They
were the last two in the party.</p>

<p>“There is no need of our being severe with
you any longer,” continued the man. “Our task
is accomplished, our route is located, no one can
interfere with us now. But you understand it
was necessary, in order to carry out our scheme
successfully, that we shouldn’t be disturbed until
after we were through the gap. We couldn’t
run the risk of having you go back up or down
the road and rouse the country, or the other
corps of engineers, or even the owner of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
property. So we had to take you along with us.
I am sorry to have caused you any inconvenience
or anxiety, and I am sure I beg your pardon if
I have done so; but really, you see, we couldn’t
help it.”</p>

<p>He had a very musical voice and winning
manner, this big engineer, now that the stress of
his work was off his mind; and Dannie felt at
once the strange attraction of his presence.</p>

<p>“Oh! it don’t matter very much,” he replied,
“so long as I get home before daylight. They&mdash;they
don’t know I’m out.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he glanced back over his shoulder
toward the eastern sky, already paling perceptibly
at the horizon.</p>

<p>“Do you live far from here?” inquired the
man.</p>

<p>“Not very far; just up the road a ways.”</p>

<p>“At what house? I used to be somewhat
acquainted about here years ago. Maybe I know
your people.”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why&mdash;well, if you please, I’d rather
not tell.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t. It’s none of my business anyway.
But let me ask you just one question. Do
you know Abner Pickett?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I do.”</p>

<p>“Does he still own this gap?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, he does.”</p>

<p>“Do you know&mdash;is he well?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I believe so. I saw him yesterday;
he went up to Port Lenox.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, my boy, thank you. Do you
happen to know whether he objects to having a
railroad in the gap?”</p>

<p>“I think he does. I heard him say last night
that&mdash;that&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t think he wants a railroad
across his property. I think he’d like to see all
the railroad stakes pulled out.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>After that, for some minutes, there was silence.
The man seemed to be in deep thought, and
Dannie pondered long over a question he desired
to ask. At last he found courage to ask it.</p>

<p>“Is it wrong&mdash;is it against the law to pull out
railroad stakes?”</p>

<p>“Well, I think the court would deal pretty
severely with a person convicted of pulling out or
destroying stakes set by an engineer.”</p>

<p>“Would such a person have to go to jail?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should think it very likely. Why do you
ask?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I knew a fellow once who&mdash;who&mdash;started
to pull some out.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing he didn’t get any farther
with it. A county jail is not a pleasant place in
which to spend one’s time.”</p>

<p>Dannie knew that. He had visited the jail
once, with his grandfather, and had seen the prisoners
in their little iron-barred cells, and had
thought how dreadful it must be to be locked up
there, especially in the night-time.</p>

<p>But there was one hope still left to him.</p>

<p>“Suppose,” he suggested, “suppose the man
who pulled out the stakes was the one who
owned the land?”</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t help it much. A railroad has
a right to locate its route through any man’s land.”</p>

<p>“But suppose they drove their stakes in his
graveyard?”</p>

<p>The man stopped short and looked his questioner
in the eyes. But a cloud had come up and
covered the face of the moon, and the shadow of
it made the boy’s features indistinct. Yet these
were strange questions for a lad of his size to be
asking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t think,” replied the man, as he started
on, “I don’t think that a railroad company would
have a right to locate its route through a graveyard,
and if it did&mdash;well, if it was my graveyard,
I believe I would pull up the stakes set in it and
throw them into the brook.”</p>

<p>“Thank you! Oh, thank you! That’s just
what&mdash;what a fellow did once that I knew.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he&mdash;he&mdash;” But in the midst of his
stammering a new thought came to him. “You
ran your line through a graveyard, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean Abner Pickett’s graveyard?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“No; I went around it. I followed my tangent
to the south side of the brook opposite the
graveyard,&mdash;there’s a bit of shelving beach there
which gave room for the location,&mdash;and then I
put in a reverse curve and came down on this side
again, just at the entrance to the gap. Here, I’ll
show you how I did it. Come on!”</p>

<p>The rest of the party, walking more rapidly,
were far ahead. The engineer quickened his
pace, and Dannie hurried along by his side.
The subject had become one of absorbing interest
to both of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“My knowledge of the locality,” continued the
man, “served me handsomely for a night survey.
I used to know every foot of the ground here
when I was a boy. I knew where the trout hid
in this stream. I knew where the squirrels ran
over that hill. I knew where the blackberries
were most luscious, and where the nuts fell thickest
in the first frost. Why, I could have walked,
barefooted, from end to end of this gap, on the
darkest night you ever saw, and never stubbed my
foot against a stone, I was so familiar with the
road. Oh, those were happy days!”</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the western opening
into the glen.</p>

<p>“Here,” said the man, pointing to a stake at
the roadside, “here is where we come in, and
there,” indicating the curve with a sweep of his
arm, “is where we cross the brook, crowd the foot
of the ledge opposite the graveyard, and strike a
tangent that carries us in a straight line for more
than fifteen hundred feet.”</p>

<p>“I’m so glad you didn’t touch the graveyard!”
said Dannie.</p>

<p>“My boy, if this railroad is not built until I
run a line for it through that burial-place, you will
never live to see the first tie laid. Abner Pickett<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
himself holds this sacred plot in no greater reverence
than do I.”</p>

<p>They were moving on up the road now toward
the graveyard wall.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad,” repeated Dannie, softly; “I’m
so glad for Gran’pap’s sake.”</p>

<p>The next moment the man had a strong hand
on each of the boy’s shoulders, and was looking
down into his face with a fierce eagerness that
frightened him.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he demanded. “Tell me
your name, quick!”</p>

<p>That imperative request gave room for no evasion.
There could be but one reply.</p>

<p>“I’m Abner Pickett’s grandson,” faltered the
boy. “My name is Dannie Pickett.”</p>

<p>The man loosed his grip on the lad’s shoulders
and took his hands instead. Dannie felt those
clear blue eyes piercing him through and through.
For a full minute they stood thus, then the grasp
was relaxed, the man turned his face upward in the
moonlight, and it seemed as if he were in prayer.
When Dannie saw his eyes again they were full of
tears; but there was a smile on his countenance,
and, when he spoke, his voice was very sweet and
gentle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do not mind me,” he said. “I have a boy
whom I have not seen since he was a little baby.
You must be about his age. I think you must
look very much like him. Strangest of all, his
name, too, is Dannie. Come, let us go. It will
soon be daylight. See the red in the east. I
must find my men, and you must get to your
home.”</p>

<p>He took the boy’s hand and they started on.
But Dannie’s heart was beating to the music of
this man’s voice, and, swayed by the spell of his
presence, he felt that to him must be told the
secret of his midnight errand in the glen.</p>

<p>“I want to tell you,” he said, “what I was
doing in the gap to-night. I feel as though you
ought to know.”</p>

<p>“No,” was the quick reply; “you need not
confide in me. I cannot counsel you now.
Others must do that yet for a time. I only
trust that your errand was one of which you need
not be ashamed. Do I walk too fast for you?
There is so little time to lose.”</p>

<p>When they came opposite the marble column
that marked the grave of Dannie’s mother, they
stopped instinctively.</p>

<p>“This is Gran’pap’s graveyard,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
boy, simply, “and that is where my mother is
buried.”</p>

<p>The man did not answer.</p>

<p>He had removed his hat and stood gazing intently
at the white shaft and at the vine-covered
mound at its base. For a full minute he stood
there, motionless as the monument itself. Then
he turned to the boy.</p>

<p>“Let the thought of her be as dear and
sweet to you always as your own life,” he said.
“Come!”</p>

<p>With Dannie’s hand still in his, he hastened on.
The other members of the party were far ahead.
The morning glow was spreading in the east, and
in the west the paling moon was dropping down
behind the far-off hills. The autumn mist came
up and compassed them about, and now and then
some sound betokening daybreak came muffled
to their ears. On the souls of both the solemn
hush of morning rested, and neither of them broke
it by a single word.</p>

<p>When the gate that led to the Pickett farmhouse
was reached, they both stopped. Again
the man bared his head as he gazed through the
morning mist at the dim outline of the old
homestead. Then he bent down and took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Dannie’s face between his hands, and touched
the tangled hair on the boy’s forehead with his
lips.</p>

<p>“Good-by!” he said. “<a href="#image04">Good-by, my boy</a>;
and God bless you and keep you!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 422px;">
<a name="image04" id="image04">
  <img src="images/image04.jpg" width="422" height="600"

       title="“‘Good-by, my boy!’”" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_67">“‘Good-by, my boy!’”</a></div>
</div>

<p>The next moment he was gone, a stalwart,
splendid figure, striding like an athlete through
the luminous haze.</p>

<p>Is it strange that up from Dannie’s heart came
again the old desire, and out from his lips the
spoken longing:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, if I only had a father&mdash;like him!”</p>

<p>But there was no time now to indulge in
dreams or disappointments. He felt that he
must get at once into the house and to bed.</p>

<p>He went up the side path, and around to the
woodshed, where he left the hatchet. Max, the
dog, came whining and crouching at his feet, begging
for notice and caresses. Dannie paid little
heed to him, but hurried on. As he turned the
corner of the house by the kitchen porch, he came
face to face with his grandfather.</p>

<p>“Why, Dannie!” exclaimed the old man,
“what routed you out so early this morning?”</p>

<p>For a moment Dannie was at a loss for an
answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh!” he stammered at last, “I&mdash;I just
thought I’d come out and look around.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I thought I’d do, too,” was
the response. “I kind o’ want to see where
those stakes are set. I want to know how much
o’ my land, an’ what part of it, I’m expected to
present to the railroad company. Would you
like to come along, Dan?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Gran’pap, I would.”</p>

<p>They passed out at the gate and down the
road, and Dannie led the way to the potato field.</p>

<p>Near the big rock they found a stake. It was
one set by the engineers who made the last survey,
but it was within five feet of the place occupied
by the one Dannie had pulled out the night
before. The old man gazed at it bitterly.</p>

<p>“Takes the best part o’ the lot,” he said.
“Spoils the meadow,” he continued, as he looked
down the line, “cuts my farm in two, prevents
me from gettin’ to water, destroys the public
road, a damage and a curse.”</p>

<p>They followed down the line of stakes as he
talked. The survey took almost exactly the
same route as had the one made by the D. V.
&amp; E. engineers the afternoon before. The crossing
at the public road was not five feet from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
first location, for Dannie saw the place in the bank
where he had pulled out the stake.</p>

<p>“Ruins the road,” muttered the old man,
“ruins the brook, ruins the gap, ruins the farm,
despoils the tomb!”</p>

<p>He was working himself into a passion again.
Dannie foresaw that in ten minutes more he would
be at a white heat.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you pull the stakes out, Gran’pap,
an’ throw ’em into the brook?”</p>

<p>Dannie never knew what strange impulse forced
him to ask that question. The old man turned
on him instantly.</p>

<p>“Don’t speak of it; it’s against the law.”</p>

<p>“But you said last night that no better deed
could be done.”</p>

<p>“I was in a temper last night an’ said things I
shouldn’t. No Pickett was ever yet arrested for
violatin’ the law. You and I don’t want to be
the first ones.”</p>

<p>“It might be done in the night-time, Gran’pap,
an’ no one be the wiser.”</p>

<p>Some fate was surely leading Dannie to his own
undoing.</p>

<p>“No, that’d be cowardly, an’ no Pickett was
ever yet a coward.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Dannie winced as though his grandfather had
dealt him a physical blow.</p>

<p>They were walking on down the road now
toward the graveyard wall. The bitterness in
the old man’s heart forced itself again to his
lips.</p>

<p>“They might ’a’ taken my land, an’ my road,
an’ my stream, an’ my gap, an’ all, if they’d only
’a’ let my graveyard alone. I can’t stand that.
I won’t stand that. I’ll fight that. I’ll show ’em
that imposin’ on the livin’ is one thing an’ insultin’
the dead is another. I’ll make ’em&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, his gaze fixed on the
line of stakes as it skirted the shore of the brook
and then crossed to the other side of the stream
opposite the graveyard.</p>

<p>“Dannie!” he exclaimed, “look! There they
go across the brook. They don’t touch the
graveyard. Do you see? They don’t touch it!”</p>

<p>He was pointing with intense excitement to
the staked-out curve showing distinctly under the
rising bank of fog.</p>

<p>“That line don’t go within ten rods o’ the
graveyard anywhere, Dannie,&mdash;not within ten
rods. Come, let’s see!”</p>

<p>He started on at a rapid pace, and, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
waiting to go in by the entrance, began hastily to
climb over the stone wall that surrounded the
burial-place. Reaching the centre of the plot,
halfway between the monument and the road, he
looked searchingly about him.</p>

<p>“Not a stake, Dannie!” he cried. “Not a
stick nor a stone anywhere inside. Not one!”</p>

<p>He was as intensely delighted as though he
had come suddenly upon a mine of hidden
treasure. The reaction from his state of mental
misery was too great to be concealed, even had
he desired to hide it. All night his distressed
fancy had conjured up visions of his burial-plot
ripped and torn with plough and pick and spade,
of his monument and headstone begrimed with
the smoke and shrinking from the touch of the
shrieking, thundering, plunging monster of the
rail. All night, in sleepless torture, his embittered
heart had burned with what he thought to
be an insult to the living and an outrage on the
dead. And now, to find his fancies and his
fears suddenly dispelled was like waking from
a dreadful dream. “But”&mdash;he turned sharply
on the boy at his side:&mdash;</p>

<p>“You told me they ran through the graveyard!
Why did you tell me that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well&mdash;they&mdash;they&mdash;I saw them in here,
anyway. They must ’a’ changed it afterward.
I can show you the place where the stake was
set.”</p>

<p>Sure enough he could, and did. The hole left
by it was still distinctly visible. And he pointed
out also where the grass was bruised by the
treading of feet and the dragging of the chain
across it.</p>

<p>The old man was satisfied, but Dannie’s mind
was in a tumult. He hardly knew which way to
turn or what to say. He dreaded every question
that might be asked him, lest the answer to it
should involve him in some hopeless contradiction.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Oh, what a tangled web we weave<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When first we practise to deceive!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Abner Pickett’s delight at finding his
graveyard free left him in no mood to question or
to criticise. The predominant thought in his
mind was that the engineer, at the cost of increased
distance, heavier grading, and additional
curvature, had avoided cutting through his graveyard.
It relieved his mind and gratified his pride.</p>

<p>“Look, Dannie!” he exclaimed, with a sweep
of his arm toward the mouth of the gap, “ain’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
that a beautiful curve? I tell you the engineer
that laid that out knew his business. What kind
of a lookin’ man did you say he was, Dannie?”</p>

<p>“Tall, Gran’pap. Han’some. Light hair, and
blue eyes that looked you through. Voice like
a&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What, Dannie! What! Light hair an’ blue
eyes?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;no. The man I talked with yesterday
afternoon had dark eyes an’ hair an’ whiskers.
I don’t know as he was so very tall, either. I
don’t know,&mdash;oh, I don’t know anything, I’m so
tired an’ hungry an’ done out!”</p>

<p>And he was tired and hungry and done out.
He dropped to the greensward at his grandfather’s
feet, this boy of thirteen, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>And Abner Pickett, believing that the boy had
undergone only what he himself had suffered,
bent down to him with soothing words, lifted him
to his feet, and, hand in hand, through the ever
deepening mist, these two walked the road toward
home.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>


<p class="cap">It is the law in Pennsylvania that when a railroad
company locates its route for a railroad
by making its survey and setting its stakes,
and that route is duly approved by its board of
directors, it can hold the location as against any
other company making a subsequent survey.</p>

<p>At the time of the events here recorded, two
rival railroad corporations had become suddenly
aware of the value of Pickett’s Gap as an outlet
from the anthracite coal fields easterly to the
Delaware river and to tidewater. Not that the
project of building a railroad across that section
of country was by any means a new one. On the
contrary, it had been talked of for years. Indeed,
a survey had once been made to within a mile of
the mouth of the gap, but the stakes had rotted
away or been destroyed long before. It was due
to a combination of certain great railroad and coal
interests that the subject had been now revived.
And the engineers, looking over the ground, became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
suddenly impressed with the importance of
securing the Pickett’s Gap route. From that
moment it was a race between the Delaware Valley
and Eastern Railroad Company and the Tidewater
and Western Railroad Company to secure
the right of way through Pickett’s Gap. This
gorge, the only opening for fifteen miles through
the ridge that flanked the westerly shore of the
Delaware, became thenceforth the objective point
toward which the engineers of both railroad companies
bent all their energies. The D. V. &amp; E.
worked up toward it from the Delaware and the
east; while the T. &amp; W. came down the country
from the west, adopting, unknown to its rival, the
old survey of former years. From information
received at the office of the T. &amp; W. it was
known that Nicholson, the D. V. &amp; E. engineer,
was, on a certain day in September, working up
from the shore of the Delaware toward the mouth
of the gorge, and that, in all probability, he would
set his stakes in that coveted glen on the following
day. There was only one way to outwit him
and gain precedence, and that was by connecting
with the terminal point of the old survey, and
making a night location through the gap. This
scheme originated in the fertile mind of the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
engineer of the T. &amp; W., and he sent his most
trusted lieutenant, Charlie Pickett, to carry out
the plan. No better selection could have been
made, for Charlie Pickett was familiar with
every foot of the ground. By his own unaided
effort through thirteen years he had risen through
the various positions of axeman, chainman, flagman,
rodman, and leveller, until now, as transitman,
he was intrusted with the most careful and
critical work of one of the youngest and most vigorous
of the railroad corporations of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>But both Pickett and his chief had miscalculated
Nicholson’s energy. Instead of stopping
for the night on the easterly slope of the ridge
that overlooked the Delaware, that wiry and
energetic custodian of the fortunes of the D. V.
&amp; E. had, as we have already seen, pushed his
survey vigorously through Pickett’s Gap, and
was the first to occupy the route. That Charlie
Pickett did not know this when, in the moonlight,
he set his stakes between the walls of the
glen, was not his fault. There was nothing on the
ground to indicate that any engineer had preceded
him. Nor did Nicholson know, when he
led his men up through the gap on the following
morning, that the stakes at which he glanced as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
he hurried on had not been set by him. The
mist hung about him like a thick cloud when he
set up his instrument near the big rock in the
potato field and continued his survey, and it was
no wonder that the change in the line of stakes
did not attract his attention. Indeed, the true
state of things was not known that day nor the
next by any person save one,&mdash;poor, unfortunate
Dannie Pickett. And the longer he held his
secret locked in his breast, the more fearful he
became of a final disclosure. How long his
reckless, not to say criminal, deed could remain
unknown to others he did not know; he did not
dare to think.</p>

<p>A few days later Abner Pickett was sitting on
his porch enjoying an after-dinner smoke. Dannie
was at school, and Gabriel was in the back lot.
A very trimly dressed young man descended from
a wagon at the front gate and walked up the path.
It was with fear and trembling that he approached
Abner Pickett. He had heard many stories of
the old man’s peculiarities, of his opposition to
railroads in general, and of his bitter resentment
against the D. V. &amp; E. in particular. He had
been led to believe that it would be almost safer
to beard a lion in its den, than to face this irrepressible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
old man in his own home on such an
errand as this.</p>

<p>It was the duty of his company, however,
under the law, to make at least an attempt to
settle, and it was his mission to-day, however
fruitless it might be, to use all of his skill and
strategy in the effort to purchase a right of way
through Pickett’s Gap. He put on a most
courteous demeanor.</p>

<p>“This is Mr. Pickett, I believe?”</p>

<p>“Pickett’s my name,” replied the old man,
calmly. “Will you come up on the stoop an’
take a chair?”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much. My name is Safford,
Mr. Pickett. I represent the Delaware
Valley and Eastern Railroad Company.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“You are doubtless aware that this company
has laid out a route for a railroad through your
land?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know it.”</p>

<p>Here the agent launched out into a eulogy of
the company, and dwelt eloquently upon the
advantages which would accrue to the country in
general, and to the owner of the Pickett farm in
particular, by reason of the building of the railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
as surveyed. Abner Pickett did not appear
to be impressed in the slightest degree. The
agent began to feel that his worst fears were about
to be realized.</p>

<p>“We need the right to pass through your
property, Mr. Pickett, and we are willing to pay
you for it, I may say liberally. Have you&mdash;a&mdash;considered
what compensation would be satisfactory
to you?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I am correctly informed, we run
through your land a distance of about seven
thousand feet. In no place do we need or take
more than fifty feet in width. That would make,
as you see, about eight acres. Now, I really
don’t know what your land is worth per acre.”</p>

<p>The rising inflection at the end of this last
sentence called for an answer; but none was
vouchsafed by Abner Pickett. He continued to
puff slowly at his pipe and gaze out toward the
distant hills.</p>

<p>“As I said, Mr. Pickett, we are willing to pay
you liberally. We consider that the right of passage
through the gap is of considerable importance
and much value to us. How&mdash;for instance&mdash;how
would eight hundred dollars strike you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The agent waited, in breathless suspense, for a
reply. The old man shifted his gaze from the
distant landscape to the agent’s face. He removed
his pipe slowly from his mouth, leaned
back in his chair, and answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Young man, it ain’t worth it.”</p>

<p>The representative of the company was stricken
dumb with astonishment. He had never before
had an experience like this. Men usually considered
their property worth twice what he offered
to pay them for it. Indeed, he had been prepared
to double his offer to the owner of Pickett’s Gap,
rather than have the slightest difficulty or delay
in procuring a right of way. When he had partially
recovered from his surprise, he found voice
to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Pickett, that gap, you know, is a
most favorable outlet for us. We really need it,
and are willing to pay you for it what it is worth.”</p>

<p>“Just so. But you can’t pay me any such
price as that. I say it ain’t worth it.”</p>

<p>The agent was still wondering whether or not
he was dreaming. But his sense of a good bargain
was beginning to reassert itself, and he inquired
hesitatingly:&mdash;</p>

<p>“What, for instance, would you consider right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Mr. Pickett? What, in short, may I ask is your
figure?”</p>

<p>“Let me see. How many acres do you say
you take?”</p>

<p>“About eight acres all together.”</p>

<p>“So! Well, my land is worth twenty dollars
an acre, take it on an average.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Pickett, that would only come to
a hundred and sixty dollars. That is&mdash;pardon
me&mdash;but that is really inadequate. Why, we
only take an acre and a half of John Davis, just
above you here, and we pay him a hundred and
fifty dollars, and do it cheerfully.”</p>

<p>“Young man, I ain’t runnin’ John Davis’s
business, an’ he ain’t runnin’ mine. If you want
that land at twenty dollars an acre, you can have
it. If you don’t, you can let it alone. I shan’t
take a cent more nor less.”</p>

<p>Continuing to protest, the agent drew from
his pocket a blank contract of purchase and
began to fill it up, drawing his chair to the little
three-cornered porch stand. Poising his pen
in his hand, he looked up at the old man appealingly:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Let’s make it two hundred dollars, Mr. Pickett.
Really, I&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>But Abner Pickett interrupted him impatiently:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I’ve told you what’s what. If you want the
property at my figure, get your paper ready an’
I’ll sign it; if you don’t want it, say so an’ don’t
waste any more o’ my time.”</p>

<p>That settled it. The contract was completed,
and duly signed and sealed by Abner Pickett.
When he had done this, he turned slowly to the
agent:&mdash;</p>

</a><br />
<div class="caption">Signing the Contract.</div>
</div>

<p>“Now, I want to tell you just one thing, young
man,” he said; “your company sent their engineers
here an’ laid out their railroad in a scientific
an’ gentlemanly way. They had consideration
for me an’ for my property. An’ above all else&mdash;far
an’ away above all else&mdash;they had respect an’
reverence for the dead. When they came to my
graveyard they turned aside an’ ran around it,
didn’t they?”</p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Pickett, I am not familiar with
the details of the location. But you have seen
the stakes set by the engineers, haven’t you?
Well, those stakes mark the centre line of the
right of way you are selling to us.”</p>

<p>“Very good. But if your engineers had
staked a line through my graveyard, regardless of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the rights o’ the livin’, or the reverence due the
dead, they couldn’t ’a’ bought a square inch o’
my land for all the money they could ’a’ piled on
my farm. An’ what’s more, I’d ’a’ lawed ’em, an’
jawed ’em, an’ fought ’em from now till the crack
o’ doom. That’s all. Good day!”</p>

<p>He thrust his hat on his head, shook hands
with his visitor, and strode away in the direction
of the barn. The right-of-way agent watched
him as he disappeared, then he put his papers
carefully into his pocket, adjusted his hat at the
proper angle on his head, and remarking to himself
that this was certainly the most astonishing
man it had ever been his good fortune to discover,
he walked down the path, resumed his seat
in the carriage, and drove smartly up the road.
It was already beginning to rain. The heavy
mist of the preceding morning had been the forerunner
of a September storm. By the time night
came, the rain was pouring down, the wind was
blowing furiously, and it required a blazing wood
fire in the sitting room of the Pickett house to
maintain the comfort of the inmates. Before this
fire Abner Pickett and Dannie were seated, while
Aunt Martha was still busy with her household
duties. Every hour that had passed since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
night of his adventure had left Dannie more perplexed,
more distressed, more conscience stricken,
more fearful of the final result of his rash and,
what seemed to him now, incomprehensible conduct.
He sat looking at the blazing logs, saying
nothing, but torturing his brain to find some way
out of the dreadful dilemma into which he had
thrust himself with such foolhardy bravery. He
did not know that he had not yet reached the
depth of his anxiety and misery; but he was soon
to learn it. His grandfather broke the silence.</p>

<p>“Right-o’-way agent was here to-day, Dannie.”</p>

<p>“The&mdash;the what?”</p>

<p>“Right-o’-way agent. The man that buys the
right o’ way for the new railroad.”</p>

<p>“Which new railroad.”</p>

<p>“There’s only one that I’ve heard anything
about. They call it the D. V. &amp; E., don’t they?”</p>

<p>“I believe so. An’ what did he want,
Gran’pap?”</p>

<p>“Wanted to buy the right o’ way for his railroad
through my property, of course. And I
sold it to him, of course. Strip fifty feet wide,
right through. Sold it for a hundred an’ sixty dollars.
What do you think o’ that bargain, Dan?”</p>

<p>“Why, Gran’pap, I’ve heard you say you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
wouldn’t take five thousand dollars an’ give a
railroad the right to run through the gap an’
through your farm.”</p>

<p>“That depends on how I’m treated. These
people acted the gentleman with me. They run
their railroad around my graveyard at an expense
to them, in the way o’ buildin’, of at least a
thousan’ dollars. If they’d a-run it straight
through, they couldn’t ’a’ got my land at any
price.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but, how do you know they didn’t
run it straight through, Gran’pap?”</p>

<p>“Why, haven’t you an’ me seen the stakes as
plain as day, a-runnin’ across the brook an’
a-curvin’ around agin to the mouth o’ the gap?
I sold ’em fifty feet wide along the line o’ their
stakes&mdash;nowhere else.”</p>

<p>“But suppose it was some other company that
set those stakes around the graveyard. Suppose
the D. V. &amp; E. had run their line right across it,
an’ their stakes had got pulled out some way, an’
what you sold ’em was really through the graveyard,
an’ suppose&mdash;suppose&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, what on earth are you cunjurin’ up?
What’s the use o’ supposin’ things that never
happened and ain’t likely to happen? You act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
just as though you’d gone daft on the subject
o’ this railroad. What’s the matter, Dan? What
ails you, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know, Gran’pap. I’ve worried
so about this railroad runnin’ through your&mdash;potato
field.”</p>

<p>“I guess we can raise as many potatoes.”</p>

<p>“An’ your meadow.”</p>

<p>“We can grow as much grass.”</p>

<p>“An’ your gap.”</p>

<p>“There’s room for it there.”</p>

<p>Dannie made a supreme effort. He feared
that his grandfather had been deceived into selling
a right of way through the graveyard, and he
felt that if he spoke now, and told what he knew,
regardless of consequences, there might yet be
time to save the old man from utter humiliation
and loss.</p>

<p>“But they did run through your graveyard,
Gran’pap. They did set their line o’ stakes right
across it. I know it. I saw ’em do it.”</p>

<p>“So you said before. But they thought better
of it afterward, an’ went around on the other side
o’ the brook, didn’t they?”</p>

<p>“Let me tell you, Gran’pap. Let me explain.
Let me&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>What Dannie would have said, how he would
have explained, what confession, if any, he would
have made had he not been interrupted, is one
of those things that will never be known. The
emergency was sudden, and he intended to meet
it at any cost. But a simple interruption altered
the entire current of his thought. The outer
door of the kitchen was opened and Gabriel
came in. It seemed as though he was blown
in by the gust of wind that followed him.
Something in the kitchen fell with a clatter, and
the old man and the boy both started up to see
what it was. The clothes-horse with the week’s
washing on it, drying and airing by the fire, had
blown over; but Aunt Martha picked it up before
it had fairly touched the floor.</p>

<p>“You always did beat the world for carelessness!”
growled Abner Pickett at the unfortunate
hired man. “Come in here and tell me what
David Brown said about the thrashin’ machine.”</p>

<p>Gabriel hung up his wet hat and coat, muttering
to himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ef lightnin’ struck ’im dead he’d jump up
an’ lay it onto me.” Then he added aloud:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Says ye can have it, Mr. Pickett. Says he
al’ays did like to ’commodate his neighbors.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” responded the old man, “on the
whole, David Brown ain’t a bad neighbor. You
might go further an’ fare worse.”</p>

<p>Gabriel shuffled along into the sitting room
and drew a chair up to the fire.</p>

<p>“Queer thing David was a-tellin’ me about the
railroad,” he said.</p>

<p>Dannie’s heart began to thump in his breast.
He knew, intuitively, that the story of the night
survey was coming. And with that story would
come also&mdash;what? He glanced fearfully up at
his grandfather, who had settled back again in his
big chair, and was puffing slowly at his pipe.</p>

<p>“Well, give it to us,” said the old man.</p>

<p>“W’y,” responded Gabriel, “seems ’at along
in the night sometime, after them first fellers had
set their stakes, ’nother lot o’ surveyors come
down the crick, an’ run another line through the
gap by moonlight, or lamplight, or suthin’. The
talk is ’at they made their survey for the Tidewater
an’ Western. Tell ye what! ef them two
railroads git to fightin’ each other, the fur’s got
to fly. ‘The bigger the barrel, the bigger the
battle,’ ez ol’ Isra’l Pidgin use to say.”</p>

<p>Abner Pickett straightened up in his chair,
took his pipe from his mouth and looked at the
hired man incredulously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fact, Mr. Pickett,” continued Gabriel.
“Queer thing about it, too. The fellers that
made the night survey run aroun’ the graveyard
stiddy crossin’ it. I couldn’t make out, before,
what them stakes was a-doin’ t’other side o’ the
crick.”</p>

<p>The old man was already beginning to lose his
temper, as he foresaw the possible consequences
to him if the story told by Gabriel should prove
to be true.</p>

<p>“Why, you fool!” he ejaculated, “there’s
only one line o’ stakes. I’ve seen ’em all myself.
I’ve been over the whole line.”</p>

<p>The hired man was not in the least disturbed
at being called a fool by Abner Pickett. He had
gotten over being sensitive on that point years
before. Seeing that his story had aroused the
keenest interest of his listener, he went on, with
the most apparent enjoyment.</p>

<p>“That’s the queerest part of it. Both railroads
claim the stakes. Fellers ’at done the
night work says they wan’t a stick ner a stake to
be seen ner found from the big rock in the
potater field to the land line t’other side o’ the
gap when they made their survey. Fellers ’at
done the afternoon work swears ’at their stakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
was set ev’ry fifty feet from end to end o’ the
line, an’ was all in place at six o’clock in the
evenin’ w’en they knocked off work.”</p>

<p>Both the old man and Dannie were listening
now with intense earnestness. Gabriel recrossed
his legs, smacked his lips in keen enjoyment of
the sensation he felt he was creating, and kept
on.</p>

<p>“Fact, Mr. Pickett! Queerest thing of all;
I’d swear them fellers in the afternoon run their
line straight acrost the graveyard. Seen ’em
drive stakes there with my own eyes. Didn’t
you, Dannie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did, Gabriel.”</p>

<p>“Yes; well, where was them stakes next
mornin’? I hunted high an’ low fer ’em;
couldn’t find hide ner hair of ary one. Stiddy
that there was them stakes acrost the crick.
What do you think o’ that, anyhow, Mr.
Pickett?”</p>

<p>Mr. Pickett turned in his chair till he was
squarely face to face with his informant.</p>

<p>“Did David Brown tell you all that?” he
asked slowly.</p>

<p>“Ev’ry word of it, Mr. Pickett, an’ more.”</p>

<p>“Then either David Brown lies, or else you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
lie, or else I’m the biggest fool in Meredith
County.”</p>

<p>Still Gabriel was not in the least disconcerted.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he went on, “jes so. David was a-tellin’
me ’at the right-o’-way agent told him ’at
you’d sold the right to build their railroad through
your propity to the D. V. &amp; E. Comp’ny fer a
hundred an’ sixty dollars. Says you might jest
as well ’a’ got a thousand ef you’d ’a’ stuck
fer it.”</p>

<p>“It’s none of David Brown’s business what I
got for the right o’ way, nor yours, either.”</p>

<p>“No; that’s right. But David, he says that
ain’t the wust of it. He says ye’ve sold ’em
the right to build the railroad where they run the
line, straight plunk through the graveyard. An’
David says he don’t believe ye sensed it when
ye done it.”</p>

<p>This was the last straw. If Abner Pickett
was angry before, he was furious now. He rose
from his chair and straightened himself to his
full height, while the hot blood reddened his
neck and face as it always did in his moments of
passion. It was bad enough, in all conscience,
to have committed the unpardonable error of
signing away his dearest rights in ignorance or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
through deception, but that his neighbors should
know of and comment on his unspeakable folly,
this was more than he could bear.</p>

<p>“Tell David Brown,” he shouted, “to mind
his own business.” After a moment he continued,
“An’ you can take your ram’s horn an’
go up an’ down the road to-morrow mornin’ proclaimin’
that Abner Pickett has been suddenly
bereft of all the common sense he ever had, and
invitin’ the public to come down here an’ gaze
upon a full-fledged fool&mdash;an’ that’s me, if there’s
any truth in your lyin’ and ridiculous story.
Who saw these men that made the night survey,
anyhow? Who knows that somebody didn’t
dream it? What proof is there? What proof,
I say?”</p>

<p>“I saw them, Gran’pap.”</p>

<p>In his deep distress and anxiety the words
escaped from Dannie’s lips involuntarily. His
grandfather turned on him in an instant.</p>

<p>“You! You! An’ where did you see ’em,
I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why, I saw a company of engineers
go up the road the morning we went down to
look at the stakes.”</p>

<p>“Humph! So did I. D. V. &amp; E. engineers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Begun where they left off the night before. That’s
as much as you know about it. Look here, Gabriel!
I don’t believe a word of your yarn. And
if any engineer went over that route in the night
an’ says he didn’t see the stakes set in the afternoon,
he lies!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Gran’pap! No&mdash;no; he wouldn’t lie!
He couldn’t lie! He didn’t lie! I know he
didn’t lie!”</p>

<p>The charge of falsehood, unjust as it was,
against his friend, the engineer, to whom he had
been so mysteriously attracted, was more than
Dannie could bear. But the old man galloped
on roughshod.</p>

<p>“I say he does lie! Or else he sent a man on
ahead to pull ’em all out before he set his own.
Like as not he’s the biggest rascal the railroad
company could hire!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Gran’pap! Oh, no, no!”</p>

<p>Every bitter, biting word flung from his grandfather’s
lips cut Dannie to the heart. It was
almost as though his own father was being insulted
and assailed. It drew from him denial
and protest as strong almost as the old man’s
denunciation.</p>

<p>“You don’t know ’im!” he exclaimed. “You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
didn’t see ’im! He’s a gentleman. He wouldn’t
do a mean thing to save ’is life! Why, Gran’pap,
he’s the one who was big hearted enough to
run around your graveyard.”</p>

<p>“Sure! sure! I forgot that. You’re right,
Dannie. He’s a gentleman.”</p>

<p>With the remembrance of that gracious act the
old man’s anger suddenly cooled. In the momentary
silence that followed, Gabriel found
another opportunity to take up the broken
thread of his disclosure.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he went on, as unconcernedly as though
the subject had proved to be the most commonplace
in the world to both his listeners, “as ol’
Isra’l Pidgin use to say, ‘Possession is ten p’ints
o’ the law when it’s a railroad that’s got it.’ An’
them D. V. &amp; E. fellers ain’t a-goin’ to let t’other
company git the start of ’em on ary one o’ them
ten p’ints.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that, Gabriel?
Speak!”</p>

<p>The old man was getting excited again.</p>

<p>“W’y, David Brown says ’at they’re a-comin’
on next Monday mornin’ to begin buildin’ their
railroad. To-day’s Saturday. David says that’s
straight. He says the fust thing they’re a-goin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to do is to cut a grade through the graveyard, an’
make sure o’ that ’fore you back out, or ’fore you
law ’em out. David says ’at it’ll go about three
foot deep through the knoll in the middle, an’
make a bank about three foot high to’rd the wall
on the east. David says ’at fifty feet wide’ll take
in the monument an’ half a dozen more graves an’
gravestones, an’ likely they’ll rip ’em all out o’ the
way ’fore they’ve ben to work there two hours.”</p>

<p>Gabriel had saved his heavy gun till the last,
and now that he had fired it successfully, he
leaned forward in his chair, placed his chin in his
hands, and gazed into the wasting fire with a
calmness born of joyful expectancy. But there
was no response to his statement. Dannie was
gazing in silent and dreadful apprehension at his
grandfather, yet the anticipated outburst of passion
from the old man’s lips did not come.
Instead, he walked slowly out into the kitchen,
and reaching up to the west wall above the
mantel, he took down from its hooks the old but
trustworthy double-barrelled shot-gun that had
served him for thirty years and more, and examined
lock, trigger, breech, and muzzle as carefully
as though he were about to defend his own
life.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>


<p class="cap">When Abner Pickett took down his gun
from its hooks that Saturday night, and
examined it, he had already determined
what he should do if any attempt were made to
grade the bed for a railroad through his graveyard;
and his determination was in no way
changed as he thought over the situation in his
calmer moments on Sunday.</p>

<p>Monday was the first day of October. The
rain had washed the air and left it clear and invigorating.
The autumn foliage was in the height of
its beauty. It was a day in which to live out of
doors and be thankful for life; a day in which to
immerse one’s self in the enjoyment of the riches
of nature. But for Dannie Pickett there was no
pleasure. He did not see the glorious coloring
on the hills; he did not feel the exhilaration of
the draughts of pure air that went into his lungs.
He was too deeply absorbed in the consideration
of the situation which his rash folly had brought
about, to see or hear or feel anything else in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
environment. If he had not removed that line
of stakes, the second survey would not have been
made; his grandfather would not have been deceived
into selling, for a song, property rights
worth many hundreds of dollars; the rival railroad
companies would not have begun the
battle for the gap, and, finally, the county jail
would not have been staring him in the face, as it
had been during the last four days and nights.
For, as he saw and appreciated more and more the
far-reaching and disastrous consequences of his
unpardonable act, leading every day to deeper
complications and graver troubles, he realized
more and more deeply how serious his offence had
been, he became more and more apprehensive of
the punishment he would have to face if his crime
should become known. He spent his days in
misery and his nights in dread, starting at every
footfall, losing his breath at every sudden sound,
awaiting, with awful expectancy, the next development
in the situation which had become, for him,
a tragedy.</p>

<p>It was with welcome ears, therefore, that he
heard his grandfather say that he need not go to
school that Monday morning. He felt that he
would be stifled in the schoolroom, that he must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
be in the open air, that he must be on the ground
ready for any emergency.</p>

<p>After breakfast the old man strapped on his
powder-horn and pouch, took down his gun,
loaded it, and invited Dannie to accompany him.
Aunt Martha watched them from the kitchen
window, as they went down the path, her eyes
filled with tears and her breast with dreadful
apprehension. But she knew that it was of as
little use to attempt to turn Abner Pickett from
a purpose once formed as it was to try to send the
Delaware River flowing back northward in its bed.
As Dannie and his grandfather walked down the
road, they came upon Gabriel who stood watching
the engineers at their work&mdash;the same engineers
who had made their survey that fateful afternoon.
They had relocated their line and replaced their
stakes up through the gap and across the graveyard,
and were now working between the road and
the brook. Abner Pickett paid little heed to
them as he passed by.</p>

<p>“Come along, you fool!” he said to Gabriel,
and the three walked on down the road. When
they reached the entrance to the graveyard they
opened the gate and went in. A fresh stake had
been planted on the knoll in the very spot from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
which Dannie had removed one on that eventful
night. It caught Abner Pickett’s eye at once.
He strode to it, tore it from its fastening in the
soil, and, with a mighty sweep of his arm, sent it
whirling into the brook. Dannie looked on in
wide-eyed amazement, but he said not a word.
While all three knew that the object of the visit
to the graveyard was to prevent, if possible, the
entry into the lot of the workmen who were expected
that morning to begin the grading of the
railroad, not one of them mentioned it. Abner
Pickett was not in a mood to talk, and the others
dared not speak of it. Even as they stood there,
the contractor, with his foreman and his gang of
laborers, came up through the glen in wagons,
with their carts, mules, tools, and appliances for
grading. Between the mouth of the gap and the
east wall of the graveyard, they halted and began
to unload their things, while the contractor and
foreman made a hasty examination of the stakes
that had already been marked for grade. Abner
Pickett walked deliberately to the east wall and
seated himself on it, his gun resting carelessly
in his lap. Dannie and Gabriel followed him,
and took similar positions at his side.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to begin in the graveyard,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
McDonough, the contractor, “and cut down that
knoll and carry it east here for this fill.”</p>

<p>“Then the first thing to do,” replied the foreman,
“is to tear away that wall, about where
them fellows are sitting on it.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. There’s where the line is. Bring
your men up and let ’em go at it. Come, gentlemen,
you’ll have to vacate your seats up there;
we want those stones you’re sitting on.”</p>

<p>This last remark was addressed to Abner
Pickett and the man and boy who kept him
company.</p>

<p>“I’m quite comfortable here,” replied the old
man; “I don’t think I shall move for the present.
Besides, these stones belong to me; an’ so
does the graveyard an’ the graves, and I don’t
intend you shall touch any of ’em.”</p>

<p>McDonough looked up at him in unfeigned
surprise.</p>

<p>“Are you Abner Pickett?” he asked.</p>

<p>“That’s my name.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand what you mean by this
conduct, Mr. Pickett. I have your agreement
of sale here, conveying a right of way through
the graveyard to this company. It was duly
signed, sealed, and delivered. I don’t know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
you have any right whatever to interfere with us
now.”</p>

<p>“There are several things about this business
that I reckon you don’t know,” replied the old
man. “For instance, you don’t know that that
agreement was got from me by deception and
fraud, and ain’t worth the paper it’s written on.
I repeat that I intend to hold possession of this
lot.”</p>

<p>McDonough continued to protest.</p>

<p>“I cannot help any misunderstanding between
you and the company, Mr. Pickett. If they’ve
done you any damage, they’re good for it. I’ve
taken this section to grade, and I’ve got to begin
there in that graveyard; so you might as well
clear the way for us. We intend to proceed.”</p>

<p>“And I intend you shan’t.”</p>

<p>The old man laid his hand significantly on the
barrel of his gun as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say you would shoot?”</p>

<p>“Ay! an’ kill to save this holy place from
desecration.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know I could have you arrested
for threats? Don’t you know what the penalty
is for murder?”</p>

<p>“Keep your distance and there’ll be no murder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Come ten foot closer an’ there’ll be blood
spilt just as sure as the sun shines above you.”</p>

<p>The red flush had mounted again into Abner
Pickett’s face and neck. He raised his gun from
his lap, and held it threateningly in his hands.
Dannie, frightened at the tragic outlook, moved
closer to his grandfather, but held his tongue.
He knew that it would be worse than useless for
him to speak. The contractor, too, had his blood
up. He was not easily cowed. His experience
in railroad building had been too extended to
permit him to yield readily to an obstacle of this
kind. He turned aside to consult with his foreman.
Nicholson, the engineer, observing the
situation from a distance, hurried back with his
men. The laborers had already congregated
about their employer. <a href="#image06">Abner Pickett</a>, with grim
determination stamped upon every line of his
face and every muscle of his body, still <a href="#image06">sat upon
the wall holding his gun in readiness for action</a>.
Dannie, white faced and fearful, but with never a
thought of desertion, sat beside his grandfather,
while Gabriel, standing near by, gripped two
cobblestones tightly in his hands.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_102">“Abner Pickett sat upon the wall, holding his gun in readiness for action.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>The consultation between Nicholson and McDonough
was short but animated, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
decision reached was evidently concurred in by
the foreman and his men. McDonough advanced
a step and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mr. Pickett, we intend to enforce our right
to take possession of that lot and begin our
work. If you interfere with us, you will be
responsible for the consequences.”</p>

<p>To all of which Abner Pickett made no reply.
He simply held his gun with a firmer grasp, and
the lines of determination about his mouth grew
more noticeably distinct.</p>

<p>After waiting a moment in vain for an answer
the opposing forces held another brief consultation
to decide upon the best plan of action.
Then they divided into three groups led respectively
by Nicholson, McDonough, and the foreman.
It was evident that they intended to
storm the graveyard from three sides. But,
before they could move to their respective positions,
a two-horse buggy, containing two men,
dashed down the road and drew up at the corner
of the graveyard. One of the men leaped from
the wagon and approached McDonough.</p>

<p>“Are you the contractor having in charge the
grading of this section of the Delaware Valley and
Eastern Railroad?” he inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s what I’m here for,” responded
McDonough, “though I don’t seem to be
getting to work very fast.”</p>

<p>The man turned to Nicholson.</p>

<p>“And are you the engineer having in charge
the fixing of permanent location and grades?”</p>

<p>“That’s about it,” replied Nicholson.</p>

<p>“Then, gentlemen, permit me to introduce
myself to you as the sheriff of Meredith County,
and to serve on each of you this writ.”</p>

<p>He bowed and handed to each of them a
document bearing an official seal.</p>

<p>“It is a writ of injunction,” he continued,
“from the court of Meredith County, issued at
the instance of the Tidewater and Western Railroad
Company, commanding and enjoining the
Delaware and Eastern Railroad Company, its
agents, employees, contractors, and engineers,
and all and every of you, that you do from
henceforth altogether absolutely desist from locating,
staking out, grading, or building a line of
railroad through Pickett’s Gap in said county, or
along or upon the approaches thereto; which gap
and approaches have been duly appropriated, condemned,
and acquired for railroad purposes by the
said Tidewater and Western Railroad Company.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>The sheriff rolled out the words of the injunction
with solemn and imposing voice and manner,
then he folded his own copy of the writ and returned
it to his pocket.</p>

<p>“I believe I have performed my duty, gentlemen,”
he said politely, “and I wish you both a
very good day!”</p>

<p>Then he went up to where Abner Pickett was
still seated on the wall and shook the old man’s
hand with hearty vigor. He had taken in the
situation at a glance.</p>

<p>“Don’t blame you one bit, Mr. Pickett,” he
said. “I’d ’a’ done the same thing in your place.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” responded the old man, quietly,
“I’m simply doing my duty by the dead.”</p>

<p>When the writs of injunction were handed to
McDonough and Nicholson, they stared at each
other blankly for a moment; then the contractor,
who had been through similar experiences before,
remarked quietly that it looked as if the game
was up.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind a little thing like an old man
with a gun,” he said to Nicholson, when the
sheriff had finished reading the injunction, “but
when I run up against a writ like this, I’m
through so long as the writ is in force. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
undertook to disobey one once up on the
Susquehanna road, and it cost me fifteen hundred
dollars before I got through with the job.
We learn by experience.”</p>

<p>Nicholson was thoroughly annoyed and upset.
He did not understand why the service of a
paper like that, on a contractor and engineer,
should have the effect of blocking a railroad; and
he said so in no very polite language. McDonough
smiled, and began to give orders to his
men about loading up the tools again.</p>

<p>“I don’t propose to get into a controversy
with the court,” he said; “we might as well
take our things back to the river. Judging
from past experiences we won’t be able to resume
work here before snow flies, anyway.”</p>

<p>He started back toward the mouth of the
gap. The sheriff, having just entered his wagon
and turned his horses’ noses westward, bowed
politely as the contractor passed.</p>

<p>Nicholson was still standing where the sheriff
found him, studying angrily the contents of the
writ. After a minute or two, he folded the paper
savagely, thrust it into his pocket, and started
back up the road.</p>

<p>When Gabriel, who had stood for fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
minutes in complete readiness to do his employer’s
will, saw the backs of their enemies turned
to them and in retreat, he could not repress some
outward manifestation of his inward exultation;
whereupon he drew his faithful horn from his
pocket, and blew on it a blast that sent the
echoes tumbling through the glen.</p>

<p>“Put up that fool’s plaything!” commanded
the old man.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Dannie and his grandfather
walked back up the road with far lighter hearts
than when they came down. The graveyard had
been saved, at least for the present, from despoliation,
and Abner Pickett felt confident that
through the medium of the law and its peaceful
operation, he could defeat any future plans of
aggression by the railroad companies. But, after
the stirring events of the first day of October,
there was no attempt on the part of either company
to begin the construction of a railroad, or to
take possession of any property along the line of
survey. All parties were quietly awaiting the
determination of the equity suit begun by the injunction
proceedings. And that suit could not
come on for trial before the December term of
court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>But for Dannie the situation remained practically
as complicated and as harassing as ever.
The service of the injunction and the frustration
of the attempt to tear up the soil of the graveyard
had given him only temporary relief. The main
issue was yet to be determined; and his responsibility
for the whole dreadful state of things, and
his daily liability to be called to account for his
unaccountable conduct, rested an ever increasing
burden on his mind. It was with him daytime
and night-time. Never, not even for a moment,
could he shake it off. Many a night he awoke
from some dreadful dream of incarceration in the
county jail, or, still worse, of fierce denunciation
from his grandfather, or, bitterest of all, of sorrowing
reproof from the engineer who had been
his companion on the night walk up the glen.
Many a night, in his wakeful hours, he determined
that when morning broke he would go to his
grandfather, to Aunt Martha, to the engineer, to
somebody, and make a clean breast of the whole
wretched business. But when day dawned, and
people were about their usual avocations, and
things wore such a different complexion, his resolution
always failed him, and the secret remained
still in his breast. He plied himself constantly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
too, with good reasons and excuses for keeping it.
If his conduct should become known, then there
would be no further question about the prior
right of the D. V. &amp; E. company to the location
through the gap. Nicholson would be triumphant.
His friend, the engineer of the night
survey, would be made the subject of jest and
ridicule. His grandfather would most likely be
held to his agreement to sell a right of way
through the graveyard, and sooner or later the
soil of that sacred place would be torn and trampled
with the ploughs and picks and spades of a
score of swarthy and unfeeling workmen. And
then, after it was known, to meet the looks and
words of those who had known and loved him,&mdash;Gran’pap,
Aunt Martha, the engineer, Gabriel,
even Max, the dog. That would be terrible.
And always, as he pondered, there was before him,
sharply or dimly, a vision of the gray and forbidding
front of the county jail with its stone-paved
corridor and its iron-barred cells. It cannot be
denied that personal fear was a prime factor in his
mind. He was but human and a boy.</p>

<p>Yet his conscience urged him always to confess.
There was one phase of the situation, indeed,
against which his conscience constantly rebelled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
The D. V. &amp; E. people were not now claiming the
last line of stakes as their own, but they were
alleging, by inference, if not directly, that the
stakes set by Nicholson were removed in the
night by the engineer of the T. &amp; W. before he
replaced them with his own. To meet this
charge there was only the declaration of the members
of the corps that made the night survey that
there were no stakes in the gap when they went
through. And against their contention was the
impossibility of explaining in any other way how
the evidences of Nicholson’s work could have so
completely vanished between six o’clock and midnight
of the same evening.</p>

<p>It cut Dannie to the heart to hear this charge
made and reiterated against the man who, in the
short space of an hour, in the gray of one morning,
had taken so powerful a hold upon his fancy,
his boyish admiration, his heart-deep affection.
Try as he would he could not rid himself of the
vision of those clear blue eyes looking him
through in sorrowful reproof. And yet&mdash;and
yet he could not bring himself to an acknowledgment
of his fault. Oh, those were wretched,
dreadful autumn days.</p>

<p>Now and again Aunt Martha tried to comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
him. She saw plainly enough that something
was preying on his mind, and in her gentle, unobtrusive
way she gave him opportunity to confide
in her, but thus far she had not been gratified by
the first whisper of his trouble.</p>

<p>Abner Pickett, too, saw that the boy was suffering,
but he imagined that it was from some
physical disorder; and one day, when Dr. Chubbuck
was driving by, he insisted that Dannie
should submit to an examination by this old and
trusted physician. The doctor, being unable to
make a diagnosis of any physical trouble, left a
prescription for some simple tonic, and promised
to call again when he passed that way.</p>

<p>So the autumn days went by and winter came.
It came early and promised to be severe. Snow
fell before Thanksgiving, and by the first of
December sleighing was general throughout the
country.</p>

<p>The trial of the equity suit was set down for
the second Monday of December, and many witnesses
had been subpœnaed from the vicinity of
Pickett’s Gap. Early on Monday morning they
had started, two loads of them, including Abner
Pickett and Gabriel, for Mooreville, the county-seat.
Dannie had not been subpœnaed. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
smiled grimly as he saw the others depart, and
thought how much more he could do toward
clearing up the situation than the entire dozen
who had been called. It was a lonely day for
him after they were gone, a dull, cold day, with
occasional flakes of snow in the air, and he was
glad when night came, and the chores were all
done, and the supper ended, and he and Aunt
Martha could watch the blaze of logs in the sitting-room
fireplace for the usual half hour before
retiring. It was a quiet half hour this night, for
neither of them seemed to be in the mood for
conversation. And yet Dannie’s mind was in a
tumult. The departure of the witnesses, the
nearness of the trial, the impossibility of his
knowing what would occur at Mooreville, the
increasing dread that for lack of testimony which
he alone could give, some terrible injustice would
be done; these things, weighing on his mind with
accumulating power, forced him into a state of
nervous apprehension and distress more painful
than any physical hurt from which he had ever
suffered.</p>

<p>Aunt Martha saw that he was laboring under
intense excitement or was stirred by some deep
emotion. She knew that it was not wise to question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
him, but gently and soothingly she placed
her hand on his forehead and began to smooth
back his hair. Somehow she felt that the crisis
which had been impending for many weeks had
at last been reached.</p>

<p>And it had. Lashes on his bare back would
never have drawn a confession from this boy.
Neither commands nor threats would ever have
induced him to give up his secret against his will.
Yet the influence of this quiet hour, this mellow
firelight, the soothing presence of this gentle
woman who had always been to him so loving,
so loyal, so truly motherlike, began to draw with
irresistible force from his heart to his lips the
whole story of his offence and his suffering. At
last, unable to repress his emotion, he dropped
to the floor at the good woman’s feet and buried
his head in her lap.</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Martha!” he cried, “I can’t keep
it to myself any longer; I can’t! I can’t! it’ll
kill me!”</p>

<p>Still smoothing back his hair she laid a loving
hand across his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Tell me, dearie, tell me what it is. I know
I can help you.”</p>

<p>Thus encouraged he poured out to her the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
whole miserable story, all of it; without reservation
or excuse, or any attempt to blame others or
to shield himself.</p>

<p><a href="#image07">“What shall I do, Aunt Martha?”</a> he wailed
at last. “What shall I do? Oh! what shall I
do?”</p>

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_114">“‘What shall I do, Aunt Martha?’”</a></div>
</div>

<p>With her handkerchief she was alternately wiping
the perspiration from his forehead and the
tears from her own eyes.</p>

<p>“There’s but one thing to do, Dannie. Go to
those who have been harmed or prejudiced by
what you have done and tell them everything&mdash;everything.”</p>

<p>“And the punishment?”</p>

<p>“Take it like a man, whatever it may be. But
they will not punish you cruelly; have no fear of
that.”</p>

<p>“And then, when it’s known and settled that
the D. V. &amp; E. was first in the gap, they’ll build
their railroad; they’ll cut a way through the graveyard,
and we can’t stop ’em.”</p>

<p>“Don’t try to foresee the evil that may spring
from doing what is right. Your duty is to act in
the present. God will look out for the future.”</p>

<p>In this wise she counseled him, aided him,
soothed him, until at the last, he rose to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
feet resolved, no matter what the consequences
to himself, to tell the whole story to all those
who ought to know it.</p>

<p>“To-morrow morning,” he said, “I will go to
Mooreville. I will get there before court opens,
and if the case was not decided to-day&mdash; Oh,
Aunt Martha! suppose they are through with it;
suppose it’s all over, and some one else is suffering
for what I did! I must go to-night. I must
go at once. I mustn’t wait a moment.”</p>

<p>“No, dearie, no. It will be time enough to-morrow
morning for you to start. You could
accomplish nothing to-night even if you could
get there. Go to bed, now, and try to sleep.
You will be stronger in the morning.”</p>

<p>He yielded at once to her wish. And, notwithstanding
the dread task before him on the
morrow, he lay down with a lighter heart than
he had known for many weeks, and slept more
sweetly and soundly than he had slept before
since the night of the survey.</p>

<p>Very early the next morning he shaded his
eyes with his hand and looked from his window
into the darkness outside, and saw that it was
snowing. Aunt Martha compelled him, much
against his inclination, to eat a hearty breakfast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and to bundle himself well against the storm.
When, at last, they heard the muffled jingling of
the bells that announced the approach of the
Mooreville stage, she put her arms around the
boy’s neck and kissed him.</p>

<p>“Keep up courage, Dannie,” she said cheerily.
“It won’t be hard when you get there. You’ve
done the hardest part of it already.”</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid any more, Aunt Martha,” he
replied. “Nothing on earth can keep me from
doing what I ought to, the way I feel about it
now. I only hope and pray that I won’t be too
late. There’s the stage at the gate. Good-by!”</p>

<p>“Good-by, Dannie! God bless you and comfort
you!”</p>

<p>He went down the path by the light of the
lamp held in the kitchen doorway, knocking
aside the loose snow as he walked. At the invitation
of the stage driver he climbed up to the
front seat with him, and started on his fifteen-mile
journey to Mooreville, the county-seat. It was
still very dark, and the snow was falling steadily,
though it was not yet so deep but that the horses
could trot along at their usual monotonous gait
until they reached the foot of the long hill that
leads to Oak Ridge. Here the driver stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to extinguish the light in his lantern, for it was
now daybreak. But, with the coming of day,
the snow fell faster, the wind arose, and long before
the stage and its occupants had reached the
summit of Oak Ridge the horses were plunging
now and again through drifts that reached to their
knees. At High Rock post-office they stopped
for ten minutes to receive and deliver mail.
From there to Lawrence’s the road was mostly
through the woods and was not badly drifted.
Then came the two-mile drive down the northwest
face of the hill range to the poor-house.
It was a tedious, toilsome, terrible journey. They
were obliged to break down fences and go through
fields to avoid deep drifts in the roadway. Many
a time it seemed as though the horses, exhausted
by their efforts, would never be able to break
through the huge banks of snow that enveloped
them. And constantly, driving into their faces,
blinding their eyes, chilling them to the bone,
the storm beat down upon the travellers. When,
at last, they drove up to the poor-house gate,
the stage driver gave a great sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“Them horses don’t go no further to-day,” he
declared.</p>

<p>“But,” exclaimed Dannie, while his teeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
chattered with the cold, “I’ve got to get to
Mooreville, you know. I’ve simply got to get
there.”</p>

<p>He felt that he could not afford to entertain
for a moment the idea of delay.</p>

<p>“Well,” was the response, “if you’ve got to
go, you an’ me can try to foot it for the next
stretch; mebbe we can get along, but them
horses has got to stay here. I can’t afford to
lose ’em jest yet.”</p>

<p>He unhitched the team and drove it into shelter.
Then, in spite of protests from the occupants
of the house, he and Dannie started out to face
the storm on foot; the one with the mail-bag
flung over his shoulder, the other bearing no burden
save the ever present, ever growing fear that
he would reach Mooreville too late to fully accomplish
his still resolute and unyielding purpose.
Had it not been a self-imposed task,
it would have been a cruel one for either man
or boy.</p>

<p>Hour by hour the storm grew fiercer, the
drifts deeper, the journey more desperate. Now
and again the travellers dragged themselves along
by the rails of the roadside fences, and many a
time they searched in vain for well-known landmarks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to guide them on their way. There was
but one relieving feature in the situation,&mdash;it was
not severely cold. Had it been, both man and
boy would surely have perished.</p>

<p>When they reached Keene’s, the stage driver
gave up the task.</p>

<p>“I won’t go no further,” he declared, “Uncle
Sam or no Uncle Sam. Me an’ this mail-bag
stays here till it’s fit for man an’ beast to be out.
Come on into the house.”</p>

<p>Dannie followed him in.</p>

<p>“I’ll go in for a few minutes an’ get warm,” he
said, “then I’ll push ahead. Oh! it’s no use,”
as the driver began to protest, “I’ve got to get
there, whether or no. It’s only four miles farther,
an’ there are plenty of houses on the way.”</p>

<p>When old Ezra Keene heard that Dannie intended
to continue the journey to Mooreville, he
shook his head vigorously.</p>

<p>“Can’t be done,” he said. “Never see sech a
storm sence I’ve been here, an’ that’s nigh on to
forty year.”</p>

<p>Still Dannie insisted.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to go,” he said. “I’ve got to get
there. If I don’t get there, something terrible
may happen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“An’ ef ye start out in this storm, suthin’ turrible’s
sure to happen&mdash;so there ye air.”</p>

<p>The old man smiled, hobbled to the window and
looked out. He came back to the stove, shaking
his head more vigorously than before. But Dannie
was already buttoning up his great-coat, and pulling
his cap down over his ears. Then the stage
driver, who had been crouching over the fire,
arose and added his protest in no delicate or uncertain
terms.</p>

<p>“No one but a born fool,” he concluded,
“would think of undertaking sech a thing. Fer
Heaven’s sake be decent an’ sensible, an’ stay where
you’re well off.”</p>

<p>But Dannie was not to be deterred nor swayed
from his purpose. Neither abuse nor ridicule nor
the power of the storm was sufficient to alter his
determination to do all that lay in his power to
right the wrong he felt he had committed, before
it should be forever too late.</p>

<p>He opened the farmhouse door and started out
into the tempest. The stage driver rammed his
hands deep into his trousers pockets and turned
away in disgust at what appeared to him to be
the inexcusable foolhardiness of the boy. Old
Ezra Keene, looking from a window, saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
lad struggle through a huge drift at the roadside,
and then disappear in a whirling cloud of
snow. He threw up his hands and dropped his
head, as much as to say that it was all over, and
came back and sat down by the stove.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the stage driver, unable to
repress his grim forebodings and the natural impulse
of his kind heart, yet with words of anger
on his lips, flung himself into his great-coat, cap,
and mittens, and started out to drag the boy back
from what seemed certain death. A farmhand
from Keene’s accompanied him, and, together,
they faced the storm and buffeted the
drifts for hours without success. At dusk, they
returned to the house, and reported that they had
found no trace, whatever, of the missing lad.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>


<p class="cap">The celebrated equity case of the Tidewater
and Western Railroad Company <i>vs.</i>
the Delaware Valley and Eastern Railroad
Company came on to be heard at Mooreville on
the second Monday of December term. The
question at issue was the priority of right to build
a railroad through Pickett’s Gap. When court
convened at two o’clock, the court room was
crowded. The case had aroused great public
interest and curiosity. Besides the local counsel
engaged, there were eminent lawyers in attendance
from New York and Philadelphia. There was
bound to be some nice legal sparring, and people
wanted to see and hear it. The battle began
soon after the case was opened, when the Tidewater
and Western offered in evidence their paper
title to the route acquired by them from the old
Lackawanna Company. The D. V. &amp; E. people
had not expected this, and it provoked a
prolonged contest between counsel. Indeed, the
better part of the afternoon was occupied in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
effort to get this title in evidence. When it was
finally admitted another struggle was immediately
precipitated by the offer of the minutes of the
meeting of the board of T. &amp; W. directors, at
which the route through Pickett’s Gap was
formally adopted. And when this contention
was settled in favor of the T. &amp; W. it was time
for adjournment.</p>

<p>Just enough evidence had been taken to whet
the appetite of the public for more. And when
court was opened at nine o’clock on the following
morning the court room was again crowded, notwithstanding
the fierce snow-storm that was raging
outside. Pickett, the T. &amp; W. engineer, and his
assistants were put on the stand to identify the
map of the route and to testify regarding the right
location through Pickett’s Gap. There was very
little cross-examination. The defence were evidently
saving their ammunition. Then the
plaintiff rested, and the D. V. &amp; E. took up
their side of the case. Their charter was admitted
without objection; but over the testimony
showing the adoption, by the board, of the
Pickett’s Gap route, there was a lively tilt. Indeed,
it appeared from the evidence in the case
that the directors of both companies had held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
their meetings on the same day, and at practically
the same hour, for the purpose of receiving the
report of the engineer and adopting the route
recommended by him. There was also a long
contest over the admission of the route-map and
profile, and when these were finally admitted the
court adjourned for the noon recess. The wind
was playing wildly with the driving snow, and
across the paths through the court-house square
great drifts had already formed. Lawyers, witnesses,
and spectators set their faces against the
storm, pulled the collars of their great-coats up
about their ears, and struggled to their hotels and
homes. At two o’clock they all struggled back
again through the still driving, drifting snow. Indeed,
the crowd was even greater than at the morning
session. Nicholson, the D. V. &amp; E. engineer,
and every member of his corps were called on
the stand to testify to the setting of the stakes,
through Pickett’s Gap, on the afternoon of September
twenty-seventh. No amount or severity
of cross-examination could shake the testimony of
any of them on that point. Nor could any of them
explain why the stakes were not still in position
(if they were not) when Pickett made his survey
some six or eight hours later. Nicholson declared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
however, in answer to a question on direct examination,
that the surreptitious removal of the
stakes would benefit no one unless it might be
the T. &amp; W. Railroad Company. But this objectionable
answer was, on motion of counsel for
the T. &amp; W., stricken from the record. Templeton,
the Philadelphia lawyer, took up the cross-examination.</p>

<p>“It appears,” he said to Nicholson, “from this
map which I have before me, that you located
your route directly through the Pickett graveyard.
Is that true?”</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>“And in making your relocation did you again
pass through the graveyard?”</p>

<p>“We did.”</p>

<p>“Is there any other practicable route by which
to reach the entrance to the gap except the one
occupied by the Tidewater and Western running
to the south side of the brook?”</p>

<p>“There is no other.”</p>

<p>“If then it should turn out that your company
has no legal right to occupy this graveyard as a
site for a railroad, you would find it difficult to
effect an entrance to the gap from the west?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, practically impossible.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“And did you not know, when you projected
your line across that graveyard, that your company,
by virtue of the laws of Pennsylvania, had
no right to occupy it with a railroad?”</p>

<p>“I knew that we had no right without the consent
of the owner. That consent, however, has
been obtained.”</p>

<p>“In what way?”</p>

<p>“By fraud!”</p>

<p>It was not the witness who made this answer;
it was Abner Pickett. Seated on the front row of
benches, within easy distance of the witness stand,
he had absorbed the testimony with intense interest,
holding himself in check with remarkable
self-restraint until Templeton’s question gave him
an opportunity for a verbal shot which he had not
the power to repress. Every eye in the court
room was turned on him, but he cared little for
that. A tipstaff came up and warned him not to
repeat the offence, and then the examination of
witnesses was resumed.</p>

<p>And so Abner Pickett sat, that morning, and
looked upon and listened to his own son, Dannie’s
father, as he gave his testimony on the witness
stand. Handsome, manly, frank in all his
answers, the impression created by Charlie Pickett,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
both in the mind of the court and in the
minds of the spectators, was a most favorable one.
Long before he had finished there was not an unprejudiced
person in the court room who was willing
to believe, for a moment, the insinuation
made by Nicholson that the D. V. &amp; E. stakes
had been removed under Pickett’s direction for
the benefit of the T. &amp; W. And when, on
cross-examination, he was pressed to give his reason
for going around instead of across the Pickett
graveyard, he was content to reply simply that
he understood that the right of eminent domain,
conferred by the commonwealth of Pennsylvania
upon railroad corporations, did not include the
right to occupy burial-places. And Abner Pickett,
who knew of his son’s far deeper reason for
not crossing the graveyard, listened with bowed
head, appreciating to the full the delicacy which
so skilfully avoided the thrusting of personal and
family sentiments and secrets before the court and
the public. It was the first time in thirteen years
that he had looked upon Charlie’s face. He could
not help but observe how mature and manly the
boy had grown; he could not help but admire
his stalwart figure, his handsome countenance,
his graceful bearing. He could not wholly repress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the feeling of pride that would swell up in
his heart as he looked upon this splendid specimen
of young manhood, and listened to his answers,
given with a quickness and rare intelligence
not often found in the court room. “This is
your boy,” something in his breast kept repeating
to him; “this is your boy; this is <em>your</em> boy.”</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;and yet, for two days he sat with
him in the same room, brushed past him in the
corridor, could have reached out his arm at almost
any moment and touched him, looked
straight again and again into his appealing and
eloquent eyes, and never gave the first sign or
hint that he desired a reconciliation. Strange how
stubbornness and obstinacy and the unforgiving
spirit will rule the natures and thwart the happiness
of men.</p>

<p>Gabriel was called to the witness stand to testify
to having seen Nicholson and his men set
their stakes from the mouth of the gap westerly
on the afternoon of September twenty-seventh.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, in answer to the lawyer’s
question. “I seen ’em. They come straight
from the gap acrost the graveyard an’ up into the
potater field where I was workin’.”</p>

<p>“Saw them set their stakes, did you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ev’ry one of ’em; ’specially the one they
hammered into the middle of the graveyard.”</p>

<p>“Did you see any stakes in the gap that day?”</p>

<p>“Not a stake. Wasn’t through the gap till
the next mornin’. Then they was a plenty of
’em there; but not a sign of a stake in the graveyard.
Wa’n’t that kind o’ queer?”</p>

<p>“Very. Now, then, did you see any one
remove any of those stakes?”</p>

<p>“Not a person.”</p>

<p>“Did you remove any of them yourself?”</p>

<p>“No, siree!”</p>

<p>“Was any one with you in the potato field
when the engineers came up?”</p>

<p>“Yes; Dannie.”</p>

<p>“Dannie who?”</p>

<p>“Dannie Pickett; Abner Pickett’s gran’son.”</p>

<p>“Is he in court?”</p>

<p>“I reckon he ain’t. He didn’t come yisterday;
an’ I sh’d say he’d find it perty tough
sleddin’ to git here to-day.”</p>

<p>“Now, then, did you or Dannie Pickett
threaten those engineers with any harm?”</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon I told ’em it wouldn’t be
healthy fer ’em ef Abner Pickett was on deck;
an’ Dannie, he ’lowed ’at they wouldn’t no railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
run through <em>his</em> gran’pap’s graveyard; ho!
ho! ho!”</p>

<p>The recollection of the circumstance seemed to
amuse Gabriel very much.</p>

<p>“Funny, was it?” asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>“Funny ain’t no name fer it,” replied Gabriel.</p>

<p>Then the lawyer&mdash;Marshall of New York&mdash;put
on an air of severity.</p>

<p>“Now, sir, did you hear any one, at any time,
threaten to destroy or remove the stakes set by
the Delaware Valley &amp; Eastern engineers?”</p>

<p>Gabriel waited a moment before answering.
He was evidently pondering the matter deeply.</p>

<p>“W’y, I can’t say adzackly,” he replied
slowly, “as I heard anybody threaten to pull up
them stakes. No, I can’t say adzackly as I did.”</p>

<p>“Well, what threats did you hear concerning
those stakes?”</p>

<p>“W’y, I didn’t hear nobody threaten to pull
’em out, er hammer ’em in, er chop ’em down, er
burn ’em up. No, sir, I didn’t.”</p>

<p>Gabriel looked beamingly down on the array
of counsel, feeling that he had covered the ground
that time, at any rate. He did not know that he
had simply whetted the lawyer’s appetite for
information.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come, now, answer the question. You heard
threats, what were they?”</p>

<p>“W’y, I can’t adzackly say as I heard any
threats.”</p>

<p>Marshall, the lawyer, was becoming annoyed.
He rose to his feet and shook his forefinger
angrily at Gabriel.</p>

<p>“You know more about this matter than you
are willing to reveal,” he shouted. “Now, sir,
I want you to tell this court what you know and
all you know about the removal or threatened
removal of those stakes!”</p>

<p>Gabriel looked smilingly down upon him.</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied slowly, “ez ol’ Isra’l
Pidgin use to say, ‘Ef ye don’t know a thing,
better let somebody else tell it.’ Thuffore I’d a
leetle ruther somebody else’d tell it.”</p>

<p>“And who is Israel Pidgin?”</p>

<p>“Oh, an ol’ feller I use to know up in York
State.”</p>

<p>“Confine yourself to Pennsylvania and answer
my question. I shall try to make it simple and
direct. Did you, at any time, hear any person
make a threat to remove those stakes, or express
a wish to have them removed? Yes or no.”</p>

<p>This question was getting dangerously close to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Abner Pickett. Gabriel recalled, with startling
distinctness, that night on his employer’s porch,
when the old man declared with such terrible
emphasis that no person could do a better deed
than to pull out all the stakes and throw them
into the brook. And there was Abner Pickett
now, sitting on the front bench, head and shoulders
above the crowd, piercing him through with
those clear blue eyes. He was in a quandary.
He hesitated long before replying.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, at last, “I can’t say that I
heard anybody say adzackly that; no, I can’t.”</p>

<p>The lawyer followed up his clew mercilessly.</p>

<p>“Did you hear any one, at any time, say that it
would be right and proper to remove or destroy
those stakes?”</p>

<p>Before Gabriel could answer, Templeton, the
opposing lawyer, was on his feet.</p>

<p>“Counsel forgets,” he declared, “that this is
his own witness whom he appears to be cross-examining.
I demand the enforcement of the
rule and the protection of the witness.”</p>

<p>Judge Moore removed his glasses and poised
them between his thumb and forefinger.</p>

<p>“The witness appears to be unfriendly and
evasive,” he declared. “We think counsel is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
within his rights in pressing the question. Proceed.”</p>

<p>The incident gave Gabriel time for thought;
but if he had had a year in which to think it out,
he could not have framed a successfully evasive
answer to the question. And it added not a little
to his discomfiture that Abner Pickett’s eyes were
still piercing him like arrows of fire.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Marshall, impatiently, “answer
the question. We can’t wait all day.”</p>

<p>“W’y,” stammered Gabriel, “I&mdash;well I&mdash;”</p>

<p><a href="#image08">“Tell the truth, you fool!”</a></p>

<p>It was Abner Pickett who spoke that time,
standing his full six feet two and pointing his
long forefinger at the disconcerted witness.
Again every eye in the court room was turned
on the speaker. His arm was grasped roughly
by a tipstaff, who hurried to his side.</p>

<p>“Don’t remove him,” said Marshall. “I shall
want him on the stand in a moment.”</p>

<p>“The sooner, the better,” replied the old man,
shaking off the grasp of the officer and dropping
into his seat.</p>

<p>Marshall turned to the witness.</p>

<p>“Answer my question,” he demanded sharply,
“yes or no.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Gabriel.</p>

<p>“Who said so?”</p>

<p>“Abner Pickett.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“The same night the stakes was set.”</p>

<p>“What did he say?”</p>

<p>“He said nobody could do a better thing than
to pull ’em all up an’ throw ’em into the crick.”</p>

<p>“That will do. Abner Pickett take the witness
stand.”</p>

<p>Things were moving rapidly now. Before
Gabriel fairly knew it he was down out of the
witness box, and his employer had taken his place
and been duly sworn.</p>

<p>“Are you the Abner Pickett of whom the last
witness spoke?” was the first question asked him;
and the answer came with a promptness that was
startling.</p>

<p>“The same man exactly.”</p>

<p>“And is it true that you declared that a person
could do no better deed than to remove the stakes
set by the D. V. &amp; E. engineers?”</p>

<p>“True as Gospel.”</p>

<p>People in the court room craned their necks
and listened intently. This witness promised to
be interesting, to say the least.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Back near the main entrance to the court room
there was some noise and confusion. A door had
opened and a boy had stumbled in. Numb and
stiff and faint with cold and fatigue he had tripped
awkwardly over a constable’s staff and had fallen
to the floor. People in that part of the room
turned in their seats to see what the noise was
about, and those near by looked curiously at the
prostrate boy. He was helped to his feet by the
constable, duly admonished, and given a seat on
the last row of benches but one. It was Dannie
Pickett. How he had managed to force his
way, in the teeth of that terrible storm, through
the great drifts that blocked the country roads,
down into the deserted streets of the town, and
thence to the county court-house, no one was
ever afterward quite able to make out, nor was he
himself ever able fully to explain. It was one of
those feats of physical endurance made possible
only by the splendid power of determination, and
even then fairly striking across the border line
of the naturally possible into the realm of the
miraculous and the providential.</p>

<p>As Dannie breathed the warm air of the court
room, he began to regain his strength, and, save
the aching in his limbs, and the pricking sensations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
over his entire body, he suffered no pain.
When the mist had cleared away from before his
eyes, he saw that his grandfather, whom he
had intended to search out, and to whom he had
resolved to make his confession immediately on
his arrival, was sitting up in the witness stand,
undergoing examination. And down to his ears,
through the intense quiet of the court room, came
the lawyer’s question:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Don’t you know that the law of Pennsylvania
makes it a crime, punishable by fine and imprisonment,
to remove stakes set by a surveyor or
engineer?”</p>

<p>Abner Pickett glared at his questioner.</p>

<p>“I ain’t here,” he replied, “to tell you what I
know or don’t know about the laws o’ Pennsylvania.
If you’ve got any questions to ask about
the facts, ask ’em and I’ll answer to the best o’
my ability.”</p>

<p>Consciously or unconsciously he had placed
himself within the rules of evidence and the
protection of the law. Marshall saw that he
had lost a point, and he started out on a new
tack.</p>

<p>“Very well, Mr. Pickett. We will get down
to facts. Where was this celebrated declaration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of yours, as testified to by the preceding witness&mdash;where
was it made?”</p>

<p>“On my side porch, in the evenin’ of September
twenty-seventh; the evenin’ o’ the day the
stakes were put in.”</p>

<p>“Very good; who were present and heard it?”</p>

<p>“Well, David Brown was there for one. No,
he wasn’t, either. He’d gone home. There wasn’t
anybody there except my grandson, Dannie, and
that fool that was just on the witness stand.”</p>

<p>“Gabriel?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Gabriel.”</p>

<p>“Where did he go then?”</p>

<p>“He went to bed.”</p>

<p>“Where did you go?”</p>

<p>“I went to bed.”</p>

<p>“And the boy?”</p>

<p>“Why, we all went to bed. It was after ten
o’clock. Do you s’pose we sit up all night down
at the gap?”</p>

<p>“Really, I didn’t know, Mr. Pickett, without
inquiring.”</p>

<p>The witness was losing his temper, the lawyer
was getting sarcastic, and the spectators were
anticipating a still greater treat in store from the
continuance of the examination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>In his seat at the rear of the court room
Dannie sat, dazed, motionless, listening and hearing
as one in a dream; in his breast still the
imperious demand of his conscience urging him
to confess; in his palsied limbs no power to move.
Then Marshall took up a new line of examination.
He handed a paper to the witness directing his
attention to the name at the bottom of it.</p>

<p>“Is that your signature, Mr. Pickett?” he
asked.</p>

<p>The old man looked at the paper carefully.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, “it is. I wrote it myself.”</p>

<p>“This paper is an agreement to sell to the
Delaware Valley and Eastern Railroad Company
a right of way fifty feet in width, through your
property, on the line located by their engineers on
September twenty-seventh last. You signed that
paper voluntarily, without any coercion, naming
your own price for the property?”</p>

<p>“Let me tell you about that paper, young
man.”</p>

<p>“No; answer my question, yes or no.”</p>

<p>“Then I say, yes. A hundred times, yes. I
was neither bullied nor bought; but I was deceived
and defrauded. When I signed that
paper the only line of stakes I knew anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
about was the line that went across the brook
and around the graveyard. I supposed that was
the route I was sellin’. I said so to the man
who brought the paper. He didn’t undeceive
me. To all intents and purposes he lied to me,
and his corporation has attempted to rob me.
Do you think, sir,” demanded the old man,
rising from his chair, with the crimson spreading
over his neck and face, and pointing his long
forefinger at the lawyer, “do you think I would
sell to any person or to any company, for any
money in this world, the right to desecrate the
graves of my dead; the right to disturb bodies
that were so dear to me in life, that I would have
given all I possessed to save them from the
slightest hurt? Do you? I say, do you?”</p>

<p>Marshall was getting more than he had bargained
for; but he was too good a lawyer to permit
himself to lose his grip.</p>

<p>“Be seated, Mr. Pickett,” he said firmly,
“and keep cool. Now, don’t you know that,
regardless of your agreement to sell the right of
way, a railroad company has a right, under the
laws of this state, on complying with certain conditions,
to build its railroad on any land belonging
to any person?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man dropped back into his chair.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied, “I don’t. I ain’t a lawyer;
but I don’t believe that’s the law. They say
law’s founded on justice, and it ain’t just, and it
ain’t human for any one to have the right to disturb
my dead in their graves against my will.
God’s Acre in this land and in this age is his
holy of holies. He sends his rain an’ dew an’
frost to fall more gently on the homes o’ the
dead than on the homes o’ the livin’; and it’s the
duty, and ought to be the joy of any man to protect
that sacred place from desecration.”</p>

<p>Through the hush that had fallen on the great
crowd in the room, the old man’s voice rang
pathetically clear. On the faces of the spectators
there were no longer any smiles. The whole
atmosphere of the court room had changed to
one of solemn earnestness. Even the examining
lawyer saw that it would not be fitting nor profitable
to follow out that line of questioning.
When he again spoke it was in a quieter voice,
and on another branch of the subject.</p>

<p>“Mr. Pickett,” he said, “when did you first
see this line of stakes?”</p>

<p>“Not till the next mornin’ after they were
set.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you follow the line?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“Did it run through your graveyard at that
time?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, it went across the brook and around
the graveyard, in as han’some a curve as you
ever saw.”</p>

<p>Charlie Pickett, sitting back among the spectators,
his heart throbbing with pity and pride as
the old man’s examination progressed, heard this
last answer and flushed to his finger-tips.</p>

<p>“Were there no stakes in the graveyard?”</p>

<p>“Not one. I saw the place, though, where
one had been set and pulled out. I pulled
another out of the same place myself four days
later and flung it into the brook.”</p>

<p>Marshall paid little heed to this last answer,
although it was in the nature of a direct challenge.
A new thought appeared to have struck
him. He gazed at the ceiling contemplatively
for a full minute before proceeding with his
examination.</p>

<p>“By the way,” he said, “how early in the
morning was it that you saw this line of stakes?”</p>

<p>“Just about sunrise.”</p>

<p>“Where had you come from?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“From the house.”</p>

<p>“Had you been long up?”</p>

<p>“Just got up.”</p>

<p>“Did you go alone to look at the line?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;no; my grandson, Dannie, went with
me.”</p>

<p>“Where did you first see him that morning?”</p>

<p>“There at the house.”</p>

<p>“Indoors or outside?”</p>

<p>“Why, I believe he was comin’ up the
path.”</p>

<p>“Had he been long out of bed?”</p>

<p>“That I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where he had been when you
first saw him coming up the path?”</p>

<p>The old man waited a moment before answering.
Some vague apprehension of trouble about
to fall upon Dannie seemed to be taking possession
of his mind.</p>

<p>“Why, no,” he replied slowly, “I can’t just
say where he had been.”</p>

<p>“Was this the same boy that heard you make
that declaration concerning the stakes the night
before?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;why, yes&mdash;the same boy. Yes&mdash;the
same boy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>He spoke as if he were dazed. His voice
dropped almost to a whisper. He gazed out
over the heads of the people in the court room
with eyes that were looking into the past. He
saw Dannie as he appeared that morning&mdash;his
weariness, his exhaustion, his nervous excitement,
his utter collapse as they stood together in the
dew-wet grass of the graveyard. It all came
back to him with the clearness, with the quick
cruelty of a lightning stroke. His eyes drooped,
his face paled, his head dropped lower and still
lower, till his chin rested on his breast. People
in the court room who looked on him knew that
something had happened to him; but whether
it was physical illness or mental distress they
could not tell. For a minute the room was still
as death. Then the stillness was broken by a
slight movement among the rear benches, swift
footsteps were heard in the aisle, a boy came
hurrying down to the bar of the court. His
face was drawn and pale with excitement and
fatigue. His eyes, from which shone both distress
and determination, were fixed straight ahead
of him. As he went, he held out his hands
toward the old man on the witness stand.</p>

<p>“Gran’pap! Oh, Gran’pap! I did it. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
pulled up the stakes. I threw ’em into the
brook. I did it in the night&mdash;in the night&mdash;in
the moonlight. Oh, Gran’pap!”</p>

<p>He crossed the bar, wound his way among
chairs and tables, reached the witness box, and
stood there leaning against it, and looking up
beseechingly into his grandfather’s face.</p>

<p>For one moment Abner Pickett sat motionless,
as if he were stunned, looking with staring eyes
at the boy standing below him. Then he
reached his long arms out over the rail and
wound them about his grandson’s shoulders,
and then he hid his rugged face in the soft curls
that clustered on the boy’s neck.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>


<p class="cap">The moment of silence in the court
room was followed by a confused murmur
of voices. People were moving
about in their seats and craning their necks,
anxious to see. Charlie Pickett was on his feet,
his face flushed, his breast heaving with emotion,
his eyes fixed on the two figures at the witness
stand. When Abner Pickett lifted his face from
Dannie’s neck, his eyes were filled with tears.</p>

<p>“Where did you come from, Dannie?” he
asked; and Dannie answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I came from home, Gran’pap.”</p>

<p>“Not to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to-day.”</p>

<p>“But, Dannie, how&mdash;how&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“I had to, Gran’pap. I had to tell you. I
had to make it right as near as I could, as quick
as I could.”</p>

<p>Again the old man, leaning far out over the
rail, drew the boy up to his breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>For the moment Marshall was at a loss how to
act. He did not quite know what was coming
next. Then his long experience and his native
shrewdness came to his rescue, and he rose to
the situation.</p>

<p>“That will do, Mr. Pickett,” he said. “Dannie,
you may take the witness stand.”</p>

<p>The next minute Dannie was in the place
vacated by his grandfather, and the old man,
refusing to go far away, had dropped into a chair
by the defendant’s table, inside the bar.</p>

<p>Marshall began his questions with gentle
emphasis.</p>

<p>“Your name is Dannie Pickett?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And you are a grandson of the witness last
on the stand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And is it true that you pulled out the stakes
set by the engineers of the Delaware Valley and
Eastern Railroad Company?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, it is.”</p>

<p>“When did you remove them?”</p>

<p>“The same night they were set.”</p>

<p>“At about what hour of the night?”</p>

<p>“I think it was about eleven o’clock when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
began. I don’t know what time it was when I
got through.”</p>

<p>“How many stakes did you remove?”</p>

<p>“All of ’em. I began in the potato field where
they left off surveying that night, and I pulled
’em out all the way through the meadow, and
across the road, and in the graveyard, and down
the gap, and along the hill on the other side.”</p>

<p>“You made a clean sweep of it, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I think I found every one, as far
as I went.”</p>

<p>“Was any one there with you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I did it all alone. Oh, yes! there
was some one with me comin’ back. The other
engineers. I met ’em in the gap.”</p>

<p>“You mean the engineers of the T. &amp; W.?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“So they were with you, were they?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. But not until after I was all
through an’ comin’ home. Then they made me
go back with ’em.”</p>

<p>“Down through the gap?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, all the way.”</p>

<p>“Did you tell them you had removed the
stakes?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I didn’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did they know it?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, they didn’t. Not one of ’em. I
didn’t tell anybody, not even Gran’pap.”</p>

<p>“Did any one ask you to remove those
stakes?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not any one.”</p>

<p>“Then why did you do it?”</p>

<p>“Well, I just thought they had no right to set
’em where they did. I thought they wouldn’t ’a’
done it if Gran’pap had been there. I thought
if I pulled ’em out, they couldn’t build any railroad
through the graveyard. And then, I got
very angry at the engineer for what he said to
me when I asked him about the railroad.”</p>

<p>“What did he say to you?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you please, I’d rather not tell.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t. Now, Dannie, didn’t you know
that you were doing wrong when you removed
those stakes, no matter what your motive might
have been?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t stop to think much about it then. I
just went ahead and did it. But I know now
that it was wrong. I’ve known it ever since it
was done. I haven’t any excuse to make.”</p>

<p>“Do you want it understood that you alone
are to blame, and that you alone are responsible
for this deed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir. That’s it exactly.”</p>

<p>“Well, let us see about that. Did you, on
the evening of the night in which you removed
the stakes, hear your grandfather declare that no
person could do a better deed than to pull them
all up and throw them into the brook?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, sir&mdash;yes; I heard him say somethin’
like that.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Did or did not that declaration
have anything to do with your subsequent conduct?”</p>

<p>Marshall saw that the sympathy of the audience,
and possibly of the court, was with the
child, and he desired to trace the moral, if not the
actual responsibility for the deed back to shoulders
that would not be spared. Dannie looked
hopelessly down at his questioner, and then
turned an appealing glance to his grandfather,
who sat with bowed head and eyes fixed on the
floor, and did not see him.</p>

<p>“I’d rather not answer that question,” he said,
at last, and then added quickly: “If my grandfather’d
had any idea of what I was goin’ to do,
he’d ’a’ stopped me. I know he would. Why,
I stole out o’ the house in my stockin’ feet, so he
wouldn’t hear me. And I never told ’im what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
I’d done till I told ’im here to-day. Never!
never! never!”</p>

<p>“There, Dannie; don’t get excited. Just keep
cool and answer my question. Would you have
gone out that night and removed those stakes if
you had not heard your grandfather say it would
be a good thing to do?”</p>

<p>Again the boy looked hopelessly down at the
lawyer and was silent. He knew, in his heart,
that it was his grandfather’s declaration that had
started him on his midnight errand; but he would
rather have faced the terrors of the jail than said
so. He would not willingly shift any part of the
burden of responsibility to other shoulders than
his own. In the midst of the profound silence
which followed Marshall’s question, Abner Pickett
rose slowly to his feet.</p>

<p>“I’ll answer that,” he said. “The boy ain’t
to blame. He simply did what he thought I
wanted done. In his heart and soul the child is
innocent. If any crime has been committed, I’m
the one who is guilty of it.”</p>

<p>He spoke slowly, distinctly, yet with a tremor
in his voice that betrayed his deep emotion. It
was all out of order, this declaration of his, in the
midst of the examination of another witness, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
no one interrupted him; even court and counsel
listened with close attention until he finished his
appeal and dropped back into his chair. Then
Dannie himself was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Gran’pap!” he exclaimed; “oh, no!
Maybe I wouldn’t ’a’ done it but for what you
said; but I ought to ’a’ known you didn’t mean
it. I ought to ’a’ known you wouldn’t ’a’ let me
done it. I ought to ’a’ known you wouldn’t permit
anything wrong. And that was wrong, and I
knew it; only I didn’t stop to think. Oh, no,
Gran’pap; I’m to blame! I’m to blame!”</p>

<p>He held out his hands appealingly as he spoke,
gazing alternately at his grandfather and at the
lawyer. Tears were coursing down the old man’s
cheeks; and out in the court room many an eye
was moist watching this little drama of love and
protection, staged and played in the bar of the court.</p>

<p>It was plain to the dullest understanding that
the boy was frank and truthful, and that the old
man was not inclined to shirk his share of the responsibility.
But Marshall was not yet satisfied.
He wanted not only the truth, but the whole
truth. It was due to his client that every fact
should be brought out in detail. He took up
again the regular order of examination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“Were you subpœnaed as a witness in this
case?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Dannie, “I wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“Then what was it that led you to come here
and make this remarkable statement?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you how it was. I got to
thinkin’ about it yesterday, after they’d all gone,
and I thought an’ thought, till it seemed as if it’d
kill me if I didn’t tell somebody. An’ so, last
night, I told Aunt Martha. An’ she said the
only way to make it right was by tellin’ those that
had been injured by what I’d done. So we made
it up between us that I was to come up here the
first thing this mornin’ an’ tell it all. And I
tried to get here before court began; but&mdash;but
I couldn’t make out to do it. I&mdash;I’m sorry
I was so long comin’; but I hope it ain’t too
late?”</p>

<p>Marshall looked up at him incredulously.</p>

<p>“You haven’t come here from Pickett’s Gap
to-day, my boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I left there this mornin’ real early;
before it began to drift much.”</p>

<p>“But the roads are absolutely impassable!”</p>

<p>“I know. We had hard work. The roads
were drifted full. I came in the stage as far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the poor-house. The horses gave out there.
Then the stage driver and I, we footed it as far
as Keene’s. From there I walked on to Mooreville
alone.”</p>

<p>As he recalled that awful journey Dannie
looked up wearily, and out over the sea of sympathetic
faces turned toward him in the court
room. But he was too tired to see them. They
floated indistinctly before him. They seemed to
advance and recede, to expand and contract,
alternately to fade and find form before his aching
eyes.</p>

<p>“And did you think it necessary to come here
at the risk of your life to make this acknowledgment?”
asked Marshall.</p>

<p>“Why, I didn’t think just that way about it,”
replied the boy; “but I knew I’d done wrong to
keep it to myself so, an’ I felt that I ought to
get here an’ tell about it as soon as I could. I
wanted Gran’pap to know. I never kept anything
from him before, an’ I wanted to tell him
first, because he’s done more for me, an’ been
kinder to me than anybody else. An’ then&mdash;an’
then I’d heard that the engineer who made
the night survey had been accused o’ pullin’ out
those stakes, or havin’ ’em pulled out; an’ I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
afraid they’d try to prove it on ’im here, an’
maybe find ’im guilty of it before I could get here
an’ set ’em right. And I wouldn’t ’a’ had that
happen&mdash;why, I’d sooner ’a’ died in the snow
than had ’em do that. He was so good to run
his line around the graveyard. He was so gentle,
an’ kind, an’&mdash;an’, oh, he couldn’t ’a’ been kinder
an’ gentler an’ sweeter to me if he’d ’a’ been my
own father.”</p>

<p>Charlie Pickett, sitting back among the spectators,
felt the hot blood surge into his face, and
the paternal passion flood his heart. He longed
to take this boy at once in his arms,&mdash;this boy
whose frank acknowledgment of his fault had
brought tears to a hundred eyes, whose simple
story of dreadful daring for conscience’ sake had
thrilled every breast in the court room,&mdash;to take
him at once into the shelter of his love, and keep
him and protect him against all the world.</p>

<p>But Marshall was asking his last question.</p>

<p>“Have you anything more to say, Dannie, in
extenuation of your conduct? I do not know
what action, if any, the officers of the D. V. &amp; E.
will take against you. Your offence was certainly
a serious one. But, in view of any possible punishment
they may have in mind for you, I want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
to give you this opportunity for any further
explanation you may wish to make.”</p>

<p>“I’ve nothing more to say,” replied Dannie,
wearily; “I’ve told you all. I’m ready to be
punished for what I’ve done. I made up my
mind to that before I came here. I’m willin’ to
go to jail; except that I’d be sorry for the disgrace
I’d brought on Gran’pap an’ Aunt Martha.
They brought me up to be honest an’ good. An’
I’d be sorry on account of my father, too, very
sorry, if he should ever know about it. But
I’ve no complaint to make, an’ I’ll try to stand
whatever comes without cryin’.”</p>

<p>Yet even as he spoke, the boy’s lips trembled,
and great tears filled his eyes. He could not
help thinking of those gloomy and forbidding
cells in the county jail.</p>

<p>A gentleman who had been sitting inside the
bar, listening intently to the testimony, came
over hurriedly and whispered to Marshall. The
latter rose at once from his chair, and said to
Dannie:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mr. Rayburn, the general manager of the
D. V. &amp; E. just informs me that his company
will not prosecute you for your offence against
the law. He says he believes that your conscience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
has already punished you with sufficient
severity to say nothing of what you have endured
in forcing your way here through this terrible
storm to set us right on what has been, heretofore,
an unexplainable mystery. Moreover, he
wishes me to thank you for your frank and
manly statement of the facts. That is all. You
may leave the stand.”</p>

<p>But Dannie did not move. The revulsion of
feeling on learning that, after all, he was not to
be punished, that the iron doors of the grim old
jail were not to open for his admittance, was too
strong to be controlled. His face flushed with
sudden joy, and then the color all went out and
he grew white as death. The lashes of his eyelids
drooped upon his cheeks, his hands fell to
his sides, his chin sank upon his breast, and those
who looked on him saw that he had been stricken
with sudden faintness. A court attendant hurried
into a side room for a glass of water. Abner
Pickett and Marshall were on their feet in an
instant hurrying toward the fainting boy. But
before either of them could reach his chair,
Charlie Pickett, with great strides, had swung
himself from the bench where he was sitting to
the boy’s side, and had caught him in his arms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
He held him to his breast, looking about for an
instant to see what he should do. Then, without
waiting to follow any of the dozen suggestions
that were given to him simultaneously by lawyers
and officers of the court, he started with his
burden down the crowded aisle. People gave
way before him, looking with sympathetic eyes
on the limp little body borne so tenderly in the
strong parental arms. When he reached the long
corridor, Charlie saw the door of a jury room
standing invitingly open, and into that he hurried
and laid the unconscious boy at full length
on a convenient bench. A court attendant bustled
in with a glass of water. A young physician,
who had been sitting in the court room, hurried
in and offered his services.</p>

<p>“I am a doctor,” he said; “perhaps I can be
of some assistance.”</p>

<p>He felt the boy’s pulse, touched his cheek, and
listened to his breathing.</p>

<p>“It is only a fainting spell,” he said; “he will
come out of it in a minute. Brought on by
excitement and exhaustion, I presume. I don’t
wonder at it if the boy’s story of his journey
through the storm is true.”</p>

<p>He was chafing Dannie’s hands as he spoke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
loosening the neckband of his shirt, and touching
his cheek to note the returning circulation.</p>

<p>“Whatever he said is true,” declared Abner
Pickett; “the boy never told a lie in his life.”</p>

<p>Gabriel, who had followed the party to the jury
room, had, with a quick instinct not unusual for
him, constituted himself a doorkeeper, and was
holding back the curious and inquiring crowd.</p>

<p>“Jest a little faintin’ spell,” he explained.
“Ain’t used to court, you know, an’ the judge
an’ the lawyers an’ all, they kind o’ scairt ’im.
He’ll be all right in a minute or two&mdash;much
obleeged to ye.”</p>

<p>Charlie Pickett, leaning over the prostrate
body of his son, touched his father’s arm.</p>

<p>“Father,” he said, “I want to speak to you
for a moment. Dannie is safe in the doctor’s
hands. Will you come out with me?”</p>

<p>And Abner Pickett looked up at him coldly
and replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I’ve no call to speak to you, sir. I’ll take
care of the boy.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall exercise my right as a father in
the presence of these people.”</p>

<p>Before either of the men could speak again,
Dannie opened his eyes and looked around him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is it, Gran’pap?” he asked. “What
did I do? Where&mdash;oh! I remember.”</p>

<p>Then, as his recollection grew more distinct, he
exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I’m not to go to jail, Gran’pap! Did you
hear ’em say so? I’m not to go to jail!”</p>

<p>The horrible nightmare of imprisonment that
had brooded over his pillow for weeks had suddenly
vanished, and he could not contain himself
for joy.</p>

<p>“No, Dannie,” replied the old man, gently,
“no, not to jail. They’ve no call to punish you.
You’ve borne a thousand times too much already.
We’ll go home, Dannie. Can you get up? Can
you get on your feet? Can you walk? There, that’s
it. Hang on to my arm, so! We’ll go home.”</p>

<p>“Father!”</p>

<p>It was Charlie Pickett who spoke. The old
man did not heed him.</p>

<p>“Father!”</p>

<p>The voice attracted Dannie’s attention. It had,
somehow, a familiar sound. He loosened his
grasp on the old man’s arm and turned to look
at the speaker. Then the blood rushed into his
face again. He recognized his friend of the
night journey through the gap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m so glad to see you,” he said, holding out
his hand. “Gran’pap, this man was good to me.
He was good to you, Gran’pap, an’ to those in
the graveyard, an’ to all of us.”</p>

<p>But Abner Pickett stood speechless, with stony
eyes and rigid face. Charlie turned to the tipstaff
and the doctor.</p>

<p>“Will you kindly leave us alone together?”
he asked. “It is a family matter I wish to
settle. Gabriel, please close the door and guard
it.”</p>

<p>Then they were alone together in the room;
three generations, the same blood running in their
veins, the same family pride swelling their hearts,
the same will and grim determination shaping
every act of their lives. Dannie, stunned by the
revelation that had been so suddenly made to him,
sank back again upon the bench, looking, with
bewildered eyes, first upon one man, then upon
the other. He could not yet quite comprehend
it; but the joyful truth was forcing itself slowly
in upon his mind that this fine, stalwart, lovable
man was his father. When the door was closed,
Charlie turned to the boy. Frank, impetuous,
unselfish, as he had ever been, he spoke his
mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dannie,” he said, “I am your father. There,
sit still; wait till I am through. When you
were a baby there was a matter about which your
grandfather and I differed. I spoke to him unkindly
and in anger. What I told him was not
true. I admitted it then, I admit it to-day. He
said that no person who had lied to him once
should have the opportunity to do so again, and
he sent me from his house and forbade me ever
to return. I went, leaving you in his custody,
knowing that with Aunt Martha also to care for
you, you would want for nothing. For thirteen
years I have done penance for that lie, but my
father has not forgiven me. For thirteen years
I have looked forward, day and night, to the
time when I should claim you and ask you to
come with me, and be my son in fact as well as
in name. I am ready to take you now. I want
you. Will you come?”</p>

<p>It was so sudden, so astounding, that Dannie
could not comprehend it all at once. The bewildered
look was still in his eyes.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;are my father?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, Dannie.”</p>

<p>“Is it true, Gran’pap?”</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man, standing with folded arms, his
back to the door, his cheeks flushed, his lips set,
with lightning veiled under the cold glitter of his
eyes, looked the picture of dignified wrath.</p>

<p>Dannie turned again to his father.</p>

<p>“And&mdash;and you lied to Gran’pap?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Dannie, I did.”</p>

<p>“Is that true, Gran’pap?”</p>

<p>“That is true.”</p>

<p>The words might have come from lips of marble,
they were so precise and passionless.</p>

<p>“Father,” exclaimed Charlie, “be just to me!
Say that it was the first and last lie I ever told
you. Say that afterward I acknowledged my
fault, and asked your forgiveness, and you would
not listen to me.”</p>

<p>“That is true.”</p>

<p>Cold as ice, clear as crystal, the answer to his
son’s appeal came from the old man’s lips. For
a moment there was silence, and then Dannie
spoke again to his father.</p>

<p>“And you want me to come&mdash;to come an’ live
with you?”</p>

<p>There was a tremor of joy in the boy’s voice
at the very thought of such happiness as this.</p>

<p>“I do. I want you. I need you. I cannot
live my life as I should without you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gran’pap, may I go?”</p>

<p>At last the supreme moment had come, the
vital question had been put. Abner Pickett still
stood there, motionless, with folded arms.</p>

<p>“You may choose,” he said, “between him and
me. I shall have no divided allegiance. If you
go with him, you can say good-by to me to-day
for all time.”</p>

<p>Never before had he so veiled the passion in
his heart with calm utterance of words. But if
his speech was cool, it was determined. He
meant what he said to the last degree. He
wanted far more from his son than a mere acknowledgment
of his fault, and a petition for forgiveness.
It was not enough to come to him
with bowed head and penitent words. He wanted
the prodigal to prostrate himself in the dust at his
father’s feet, to yield everything, to receive nothing.
Strange he did not know that a Pickett
never had done that, never could do it, never
would do it; that even in the confession of a
fault, the Pickett pride would never humble itself
more deeply than honor and conscience might demand.
Yet here was this old man, in his own pride
and stubbornness, choosing to give up absolutely
and forever his choicest living treasure, rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
yield one jot or tittle of the stern law he had laid
down thirteen years before. Charlie Pickett was
not deceived by his father’s calmness. He well
knew that if Dannie came with him it would be
outlawry for the boy from the old home; it would
be the breaking of every tie that bound him to his
grandfather’s heart and hearth. He knew what
they had been to each other&mdash;those two&mdash;could
he bend himself to the severance of those sweet
relations? Would it not be cruelty to both of
them? And yet&mdash;and yet he wanted so to have
his son.</p>

<p>On Dannie’s face the lights and shadows fell
alternately. He knew not what to say or to do.
How could he choose between these two?&mdash;between
the father who had come suddenly into his
life like a dream of light and sweetness, and the
grandfather who had loved him and cared for
him, and had been his comrade and playfellow
from babyhood. Charlie Pickett, looking on
his son’s face, saw there the agony of indecision,
and his heart melted. Tears sprang to his eyes,
and his voice choked with emotion.</p>

<p>“Father,” he said, “I yield. He shall stay
with you. It is right, it is just. Some day,
when I am old and alone and need him, as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
do now, I will call and he will come to me.
Go with him, Dannie. Be good to him, as he
has been to you. Good-by! Good-by, my
lad,&mdash;good-by!”</p>

<p>He lifted the boy from the bench, clasped
him to his breast, kissed him once and again, and
then gently placed him at his grandfather’s side.
He turned to the door, unclosed it and <a href="#image09">held it
wide open</a>, standing with bowed head and
trembling lips and tear-dimmed eyes, <a href="#image09">while the
old man and his grandson</a>, hand in hand, <a href="#image09">passed
out into the corridor</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 451px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_165">“He held the door wide open while the old man and his grandson

</div>

<p>At the head of the staircase Dannie stopped,
turned, and ran swiftly back into the jury room.
He leaped sobbing into his father’s arms.</p>

<p>“Father!” he cried, “Father, I’m goin’ to
bring you an’ Gran’pap together. I want you
both. I need you both. I must have you both.
I’m goin’ to bring you together if it takes my
life to do it. I will&mdash;I will!”</p>

<p>Again the strong man, with tears streaming
down his face, strained the boy to his heart.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Dannie,&mdash;thank you! And
God speed the day of reconciliation. Good-by
again, my boy,&mdash;good-by!”</p>

<p>Once more he released him, and Dannie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
hurried back to where his grandfather stood on
the steps, fearful lest the old man might think
that, after all, he had chosen to desert him.
But the grim smile of triumph on Abner
Pickett’s face as they passed down the staircase
and out to the court-house porch, told of the
satisfaction that reigned in his heart over the
victory he had won, and over the fact that
the boy was to be his and his alone, for years
to come.</p>

<p>He stopped to button Dannie’s great-coat, and
tie wraps about his throat and ears, and then
they started out together into the snow-bound
world, pushing their way through the drifts that
blocked the path to the street; while Charlie
Pickett, looking from an upper window, with
tear-blurred eyes, watched them out of sight.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>


<p class="cap">Long after his father and his son had
vanished from sight between the great
snow ridges that lined the street, Charlie
Pickett stood at the window of the jury room,
looking out upon the wide, white landscape,
thinking of the days gone by, of the day just
passed, of the days he still hoped might come in
the future.</p>

<p>Some one touched him gently on the shoulder.
He turned and saw that it was Gabriel, and
reached out to him a welcoming hand.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see you, Gabriel,” he said. “I’ve
been trying to get a chance to speak to you ever
since you’ve been here. I’ve been wanting to
ask you about Dannie, and about Father, and
Aunt Martha, and yourself, and about the old
place. It’s been a hard day for me, Gabriel.”</p>

<p>“The’ ain’t no doubt o’ that, Char&mdash;Mr.
Pickett, I mean.”</p>

<p>“No, not Mr. Pickett. I’m always Charlie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
to you, you know. We’ve worked and tramped
and hunted and fished together too often for any
formality of that kind, Gabriel. But I am glad
to see you. Here, sit down. Tell me about
Dannie. I’ve just given him up to Father. I
had a right to take him, Gabriel; I wanted to
take him; but I knew it would break Father’s
heart, and I couldn’t do that, I couldn’t do
it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Gabriel, slowly, “I ain’t got
nothin’ to say aginst Abner Pickett. He’s
treated me like a white man fer eighteen year an’
up’ards; but ef I had a son like you, an’ a gran’son
like Dannie Pickett, I’ll be everlastin’ly gee-hawed
ef I wouldn’t git down off’n my high hoss
once’t in a w’ile, say once’t in a year to start on,
an’ treat ’em both like human bein’s. Not to
say but w’at he’s good to Dannie. W’y good
ain’t no name fer it. They ain’t nothin’ he
wouldn’t do fer that boy, nothin’&mdash;excep’ to let
’im hev the benefit uv a father.”</p>

<p>“And is Dannie equally fond of him?”</p>

<p>“Sure. They’re jes’ like twins, them two is.
W’enever an’ w’erever you see one uv ’em,
you’re jes’ nat’ally bound to see t’other.”</p>

<p>“So Aunt Martha has written me; and I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
glad of that, Gabriel. It is the only thing that
reconciles me to his loss. But does he never
think about his father? Does he never ask for
him? Does he never want him? Tell me that,
Gabriel.”</p>

<p>“Well, he ain’t never asked ’is gran’father about
ye more’n once, I reckon. I heard ’im ask once.
An’ the way&mdash;well, never mind that. Ez ol’
Isra’l Pidgin use to say: ‘You can’t close up a
crack by hammerin’ a wedge in it.’ But ef he’s
asked me about ye once’t, he’s asked a hunderd
times. He’ll come on ye sudden like, w’en ye
ain’t expectin’ it, an’ fire away till you don’t
know wuther you’re standin’ on your head or
your feet. He come onto me once’t that way las’
fall in the potater patch. ‘Gabriel,’ says ’e, ‘w’at
did my father go away fer?’ sez ’e. Well, now,
I could ’a’ told ’im, an’ I couldn’t ’a’ told ’im, an’
I didn’t do nary one. ‘Did he an’ Gran’pap hev
a quarrel?’ sez ’e. An’ bless my soul ef I knew
w’at to say. I couldn’t go to fillin’ of ’im up
with stuff about ’is gran’pap; an’ I hadn’t no
warrant to do it, anyhow. I didn’t hear ye
quarrel. ‘Don’t never tell fer a fact w’at ye ain’t
willin’ to swear to,’ ez ol’ Isra’l Pidgin use to
say. But I kin tell ye this, that ef they’s one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
thing in this world ’at that boy wants to hear
about, an’ to talk about, an’ to hev about, it’s his
father.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Gabriel. Thank you a thousand
times for telling me that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ the most surprisin’ thing about it all
is, w’at a lot of blamed ignoramuses we all be
w’en he asks any of us anything about ye.”</p>

<p>“I know you’re all very kind about it, Gabriel,
and very wise and considerate. I’m sure he
couldn’t be in better hands.”</p>

<p>“Yes, your Aunt Marthy jest dotes on ’im.”</p>

<p>“I’m certain of that. But it was a strange
thing for him to do, Gabriel, to pull out that line
of stakes. I came up the gap with him the night
he did it. He wanted to tell me then. I’m sorry
now I didn’t permit him to. It might have saved
him a deal of suffering.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s taken it hard, I can tell ye. He
ain’t the same boy he was six months ago.
He couldn’t eat nor sleep nor rest, it worried
’im so. We all thought he was sick, he fell
away that bad. Even your Aunt Marthy couldn’t
do nothin’ fer ’im. But say, wa’n’t it grand, the
way he come in there at the wind-up an’ told how
things wuz; puffickly regardless of wuther he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
spent the nex’ six months in jail or no? There’s
the Pickett grit fer ye!”</p>

<p>“Gabriel, I think it was heroic.” And the
tears sprang into Charlie Pickett’s eyes as he
thought of that pathetic little figure facing the
crowded court room, battling with his fear and
conquering it, brave to the limit in the cause of
conscience and of truth.</p>

<p>“Yes, it wuz,” responded Gabriel. “An’ how
under the sun an’ moon an’ seven stars he ever
got here through them drifts! How did ’e git
here, anyhow? He couldn’t ’a’ druv. They
couldn’t no hoss ’a’ got through. He couldn’t
’a’ walked. Goliath o’ Gath couldn’t ’a’ walked
it. An’ ’e didn’t fly. How <em>did</em> ’e git here, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Gabriel. I hadn’t thought of
it. How did he?”</p>

<p>The two men gazed at each other with a look
of astonishment in their faces that slowly grew
into awe. Then Gabriel lifted his eyes and
pointed heavenward.</p>

<p>“God a’mighty,” he said reverently. “He
done it fer ’im. Nobody else could.”</p>

<p>Then, for many minutes, the two men sat in
silence. Gabriel was the first to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’ll be goin’ home with ’im now, I reckon.
I seen ’em start to’ards the depot.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Charlie, rising and going again
to the window; “but I doubt whether they will
get farther than Port Lenox to-night. The trains
will be late, and the roads will not be broken.
Poor boy! I shall be glad to feel that he is at
home with Aunt Martha, resting from his physical
strain, relieved of his mental burden. Well,
Gabriel, let’s go back into court. I don’t suppose
they’ll want us any more, but we’ll see what
they are doing with the case.”</p>

<p>But court had adjourned. As the two men
passed out into the hall the people from the
court room came crowding by. Among them
was Nicholson, the Delaware Valley and Eastern
engineer. When he saw Gabriel his face lighted
up with a smile.</p>

<p>“Hello, my bumptious friend!” he shouted;
“where’s your horn?”</p>

<p>“Left it to hum,” replied Gabriel, readily, “to
scare off tramp engineers ’at might come ’round
settin’ stakes in the snow-drifts.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to leave it home when you
die, or will you take it along?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’ll hev it with me on that trip. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
can borrow it occasionally ef you want to. Blowin’
on it once’t in a w’ile’s a great relief to them
in misery.”</p>

<p>A crowd was gathering, and Gabriel’s sally was
greeted with a shout of approval. It nettled
Nicholson, and he turned away. He did not
care for fun unless he himself could be the
beneficiary.</p>

<p>“Children and fools&mdash;” he muttered, “the old
saying still holds good.”</p>

<p>“Say!” called Gabriel after him; “did you
ever hear of ol’ Isra’l Pidgin?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” was the quick reply, “he was an
idiot that lived up in York State.”</p>

<p>“Yes. ’Member wut he said about the feller
’at goes ’round with a chip on ’is shoulder lookin’
fer somebody to knock it off?”</p>

<p>Nicholson did not reply.</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Gabriel, “he says, says ’e,
‘that feller’s lucky ef ’e don’t git ’is shoulder put
out o’ jint a gittin’ of the chip knocked off,’ says
’e.”</p>

<p>But Nicholson had disappeared. He was
pushing his way down the winding staircase, satisfied
that, in the estimation of the crowd, he was
no match for Gabriel, and anxious to escape. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the lower hall he met Charlie Pickett. He went
up to him with outstretched hand, for he was
generous as well as impetuous.</p>

<p>“Pickett,” he said, “if I made any fool remarks
on the witness stand to-day reflecting on
you in any way, I want to ask your pardon. You
know there’s no man in the profession, nor anywhere
else, for that matter, whom I esteem more
highly than I do you. My quick tongue always
did get me into no end of trouble, and I’m afraid
it always will. It wasn’t two minutes ago that
I was crushed in repartee by that wise fool from
Pickett’s Gap, Gabriel, by name. But, Pickett,
say! whose idea was that moonlight survey, anyway?
It was a genuine <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup-d’état</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was Wilson’s scheme. Our chief,
you know. He knew that you were running
along the westerly bank of the Delaware that
afternoon and that a location by us next day
would be too late. We didn’t dream that you
would get through the gap that night. I didn’t
dream that you had been through it when I went
down in the moonlight. If I had seen your
stakes there, I should more than likely have
turned back.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s lucky for your people that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
didn’t see them, then. For the only hope you
have, the way the matter stands now, is in the
theory that your board was the first to adopt the
location. But that was a strange thing, wasn’t it,
about that boy pulling out the stakes? It wasn’t
a mere dare-devil adventure, you understand. It
was done conscientiously in order that justice&mdash;from
his standpoint&mdash;might prevail. Took some
courage to go down through that gap in the night-time
you know, and pull out that line of stakes.
But, talk about grit and moral heroism! did you
ever see or hear of anything equal to that boy coming
down from Pickett’s Gap, through a world of
drifted snow, and going on the stand, voluntarily,
to swear himself into jail just to set us right on the
matter of the stakes, and to do justice to you?
Say, it was magnificent! If I had a boy like him,
I’d keep him with me day and night, just for the
inspiration.”</p>

<p>“Yes? I’m glad to hear you say that. He’s
my boy, Nicholson. You didn’t know that, did
you?”</p>

<p>Nicholson stared in amazement.</p>

<p>“Your boy!” he exclaimed. “Why, look
here, Pickett! You’re not a son of the owner of
Pickett’s Gap, are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I am.”</p>

<p>“Give me your hand. You’ve got a father and
a son to be proud of. Why, that old man will
move heaven and earth to defend and preserve
what he considers his rights. I looked into the
muzzle of his double-barrelled shot-gun one day;
well, it was lucky the sheriff came when he did, or
I’d have been picking bird-shot No. 2 out of my
anatomy to this day. And I don’t blame him a
bit&mdash;not a bit. I’d have done the same thing in
his place. But that boy, Pickett, why that boy’s
a hero. I wondered what you carried him out of
the court room so tenderly for when he fainted.
Where is he? Did he get over his illness? No
wonder he went to pieces, poor fellow!”</p>

<p>When Nicholson once started in to talk, it was
of no use trying to interrupt him till he was through.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Charlie, sadly, “he recovered;
he went home with his grandfather.”</p>

<p>Nicholson stood for a moment in deep thought.</p>

<p>“Look here, Pickett!” he exclaimed finally.
“I don’t want to uncover any family secrets; but
what I can’t make out is why in the world, if you
own such a boy as that, he don’t know it. And,
why in all the worlds, if you’ve got a right to have
the company of a human being, with his intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and conscience and grit and grace, you
don’t avail yourself of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, Nicholson, it’s a long story. I can’t
tell it to you now. You wouldn’t understand it
if I did. But I hope some day to have him with
me. How soon or how far away that day may be,
I cannot tell. At any rate, it will take a thousand
unkind remarks from you, hereafter, to overbalance
the kind things you’ve said about me and
mine in the last twenty minutes.”</p>

<p>The two men shook hands warmly and passed
out with the crowd. Charlie Pickett went to his
hotel, but not to rest. He could not brush from
his mental sight the vision of his son’s pale face
and anxious eyes. He heard always in his ears
the boy’s pathetic voice as he lay exhausted on
the bench in the jury room and pleaded that he
might go with his father.</p>

<p>When morning came, the vision was still before
him, the voice was still in his ears. He paid little
heed to the remaining witnesses who testified in the
case, and when, after fixing a day for argument,
court finally adjourned, he went back to his hotel
with his mind in a tumult of anxiety and desire;
anxiety lest the great physical and mental strain
which the boy had undergone might bring on some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
sudden and severe illness; desire that he might be
with him, might look at him, might talk to him,
might hear his voice and press his hands. Nor
is it strange that his brief interview should have
inspired such tender and tumultuous thoughts.
Charlie Pickett’s mother had died in his childhood.
His wife had yielded up her life for her
son. His father had driven him from home.
This boy was the only one in all the world to
whom he was united in the bonds of blood and
of undisguised, untrammelled, unsatisfied affection.
The more he thought about it the more he wondered
why he had, on the previous day, so
readily yielded to his father’s stern ultimatum.
The more he considered it, the more the unreasonableness
of it, the injustice of it, the downright
cruelty of it impressed itself upon his mind.
The restriction under which he had placed himself
chafed and galled him beyond endurance.
At last, unable longer to withstand the imperious
demand of parental passion, he buttoned his
great-coat about him, pulled his cap over his
eyes, and set his face toward Pickett’s Gap,
intent on doing something, anything, to relieve
the unbearable situation in which he found himself.
A train on the Mooreville branch was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
just leaving for Port Lenox. He boarded it
hastily, and contained himself as best he could
while the wheezing engine puffed its slow way
between banks of shovelled snow so high that
half the time they hid the surrounding country
from the sight of those in the cars.</p>

<p>At Port Lenox he waited an hour for the down
train on the main line, striding up and down the
platform like a caged animal. When he left the
car at Fisher’s Eddy, the short winter day was
already at its close, and the summit of the hill
range, through which the gap wound its sinuous
way, was already all but indistinguishable against
the western sky. He started across the street
toward a livery stable to get a horse and sleigh,
but, changing his mind suddenly, he struck out
along the middle of the roadway toward the
hillside. The thought of waiting for a team to
be ready, of forcing a tired horse up the hill
through the heavy snow, was too much for his
nearly exhausted patience.</p>

<p>Many and many a time, in other days, he had
walked the road from Fisher’s Eddy to the
Pickett’s Gap homestead in time that would have
done credit to the best horse in Meredith County.
He felt that he could do it to-night. Moreover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
he knew that he needed the exercise in order to
work off, if possible, some of the surplus energy
with which his veins and muscles were charged.
Perhaps, when he arrived at his destination, he
might not be so impetuous, he might be more
considerate, more gentle, more patient under the
provocation which was sure to come, more
cautiously firm in his just demands.</p>

<p>When he reached the place where his survey
terminated, on that eventful September night, he
stopped for a moment and looked down through
the darkness to the twinkling lights of Fisher’s
Eddy as he had looked that night. Then, pushing
on through the snow-burdened glen, he recalled,
as he walked, every word and tone and
look of the boy who was his unwilling companion
on that former journey; how they noted the
location of the curve; how they halted at the
graveyard; how they said good-by at the gate.</p>

<p>Here he was now, again at the gate, almost
within sight, within hearing, within touch of his
boy. The thought of it brought a sudden
weakness to his limbs, and he stopped and leaned
heavily against the post on which Dannie had sat
one happy morning and bade his grandfather
good-by. Here he was. What was he to do?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
What was he to say? How should he enter the
house? How introduce the object of his mission?
Abner Pickett had forbidden him to
return; how would he greet him to-night? In
his unreasoning impetuosity he had thought of
none of these things until this moment. Now
they presented themselves to him with perplexing
persistency. Not that he was weakening in his
purpose, he would not admit that; but how could
he best accomplish the object he had in view?
That was the question. He moved slowly up
the path, turning these things over in his mind,
until he reached the front porch. At the side of
the porch there was a window opening from the
sitting room. The curtain had not been drawn,
and he could see in. The impulse to look before
he entered came upon him, and he pushed his
way through a huge bank of loose snow, close to
the window ledge, and fastened his eyes upon the
occupants of the room.</p>

<p>A table was drawn up in front of a great wood
fire, for it was a bitter cold night, and Abner
Pickett was sitting by it reading his paper. In
his face was still the hard, stern, uncompromising
look with which he had greeted Charlie in the
jury room the day before. There was scant encouragement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
in that face, indeed! Aunt Martha
was sitting in her accustomed chair by the fire,
busy with her knitting; and Dannie, on a stool
by her side, with his head resting in her lap,
gazed at the crackling logs and the leaping flames,
looking up now and then to answer some question
that she asked him. His face was turned so
that Charlie could see it plainly. It had in it a look
of weariness, indeed, but of content&mdash;of absolute
content. It was a quiet, peaceful, pleasant scene;
but in another moment he, Charlie Pickett, was
to break in upon it, to destroy it, to set a gentle
woman’s heart throbbing with apprehension and
fear, to arouse the unconquerable passion of a
stern old man, to plunge a weary, peaceful, contented
boy into a new turmoil of trouble and of
grief. And to what end? Simply to satisfy his
own selfish desire. A revulsion of feeling came
over him as he looked. The old man moved uneasily
in his chair, laid down his paper, and turned
toward Dannie. He appeared to be saying something
to him, and as he talked, the sternness, the
hardness, the coldness vanished from his rugged
features, and his gray eyes, piercing when he was
in anger, softened now with the mild glow of
tenderness and affection. Charlie saw it all by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the bright light of the fire, understood it all,
felt it all, and, waiting no longer, he turned away.
With his face to the thick darkness he struggled
out to the path, down through the gate, and on
into the middle of the road. He thrust behind
him his own desire, his own disappointment and
sorrow and loneliness, and once again, like the
man that he was, he thought only of his father’s
comfort and the happiness of his son.</p>

<p>A figure loomed up out of the darkness before
him and stood still.</p>

<p>“Who goes thar?” came the challenge.</p>

<p>“It is I, Gabriel, Charlie Pickett.”</p>

<p>“Charlie Pickett! An’ w’at in the name o’
the seven wise men an’ their jigger-books be ye a
doin’ here?”</p>

<p>“I came to get my boy, Gabriel. I looked in
at the window and saw that he was content, and
his grandfather happy, and I hadn’t the heart to
disturb their comfort and peace. So I am
going again. They will not know that I ever
came. It is our secret, Gabriel. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I understand; but look here! That
ain’t fair, you know. You’re his father. You’ve
got the fust right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“True, but I’m not demanding it. Don’t
tempt me. My mind is made up. Let me go
now before I falter. Good night and good luck
to you, Gabriel!”</p>

<p>He reached out his hand, and Gabriel took it
with a tremendous grasp.</p>

<p>“The genuine Pickett grit!” he exclaimed.
“You’re a chip o’ the old block, after all. So’s
the boy. Wher’s your hoss? What! Didn’t
hev any? Walked up? Well, I’ll be&mdash;say,
you’ll do! You’re Pickett to the backbone! So’s
the boy. Consarn ye, both o’ ye. Blame the
hull three o’ ye! You’re a set o’ the contrariest,
pig-headedest, big-heartedest human bein’s ’at the
Lord ever let tromp on his foot-stool!”</p>

<p>It was evident that Gabriel’s feelings were getting
the best of him, for his voice was very husky
as he continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Good night! Ef ever you want anything
done around these parts, you let me know. I’m
it when you speak. Don’t forgit!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Gabriel! Thank you a thousand
times. Good night!”</p>

<p>The next moment Charlie Pickett’s figure was
lost in the darkness, and Gabriel stood gazing at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the place where it had disappeared, muttering to
himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, ez ol’ Isra’l Pidgin use to say: ‘On
the hull, darkness covers more good deeds than
evil ones.’”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>


<p class="cap">Whenever a member of the Pickett
family set his mind on the accomplishment
of a certain object, he found no
trouble too great, no task too arduous, no effort
too severe to bring about the desired end. Abner
Pickett set his mind on going home with
Dannie. He knew that it would be impossible,
that day, to drive back through the blockaded
country roads, but that did not deter him.
There was the railroad. It was possible that
trains might be running on the Mooreville
branch. By going on the cars twenty-five miles
to Port Lenox, and thence down the river to
Fisher’s Eddy, he might still be able to reach
home that night. With this plan in view, he
hurried along to the railroad station which, fortunately,
was only a block from the court-house,
and found that a train was scheduled to leave in
twenty minutes. There was a lunch-room near
by, and, remembering that Dannie had had nothing
to eat since his early morning meal, he took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the boy in and furnished him with food. Much
as it went against Dannie’s inclination to eat, he
found himself, after having partaken of his hurried
meal, stronger and in better spirits than at
any time since his arrival at Mooreville.</p>

<p>The conductor on the branch train could not
promise them that they would reach Port Lenox
that night. Indeed, it seemed, a dozen times, as
though the cars would be stalled in the huge
drifts of snow that were piled across the rails.
But the wind had gone down, and the farther the
train went the more clear track was found, and
finally, at ten o’clock in the evening, they pulled
triumphantly into Port Lenox. The train on
the main line was four hours late, and they were
just in time to catch it. It brought them to
Fisher’s Eddy an hour before midnight. There,
where Abner Pickett was known by every one,
he had no trouble in procuring a team and a
driver who was willing to make the attempt to
get up through the drifted roads to Pickett’s Gap.
It never once occurred to the persistent old man
that it would be wiser, safer, and far more comfortable,
both for him and Dannie, to remain at the
village until morning. He had made up his
mind to set his grandson down by the Pickett<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
fireside that night, and no obstacle that had yet
presented itself was sufficient to deter him from
carrying out his purpose.</p>

<p>And, after all, the journey was not a hard one.
It had ceased either to snow or to blow. The
road up the hill was by no means impassable. It
was on the sheltered side of the ridge, and had
not felt the full fury of the storm. Through the
gap there were no drifts; the horses could trot
easily along; and, within an hour after midnight,
the travellers were in their own home. That
Aunt Martha was rejoiced to see them goes without
saying. She was spending the night as she
had spent the day, moving about the house in
an agony of fear, censuring herself constantly for
permitting her dear boy to leave home that morning
in the face of the impending storm, awaiting
news of him which she felt she must have, and
yet dreaded to hear.</p>

<p>And here, at last, he was, unexpectedly home,
safe and sound&mdash;ah, no! not quite safe and
sound; his haggard face, his lustreless eyes, his
pinched lips, his weak voice, all told a story of
exhaustion, the cause of which Aunt Martha was
not long in learning. She made ready, with all
haste, some nourishing food and hot drink, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
both the old man and the boy partook of it
freely. After this Dannie dragged his tired feet
up the dear old staircase to his own room, to his
own bed, to his own sweet pillow, and not&mdash;he
knelt to thank his God&mdash;not to the hard cot behind
the grated door of a dreadful cell in the
county jail. But he could not sleep. It was not
the joy of being in his own home that drove slumber
from his eyes, nor the memory of that awful
journey through the drifting snow, nor yet his
hard experience as a witness on the stand&mdash;it was
the joyful, the dreadful, the bewildering thought
that in one brief hour he had found a father who
was more than all he had ever pictured him to be, a
father who loved him and would have taken him
and cared for him and rejoiced in him; and in
the same brief hour had lost him, perhaps forever.
It was sweet, indeed, to have found him, but it
was terrible, very terrible, so soon to have lost
him. And yet Dannie felt, he knew, that his
proper place was with the grandfather who had
been so good to him, so kind, so tender, so absolutely
true.</p>

<p>In all the journey from Mooreville to the door
of the Pickett homestead, Abner Pickett had never
once spoken of his son, of the scene in the jury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
room, or of his triumphant possession of his
grandson; and Dannie knew that these things
must remain forbidden subjects, as all things
pertaining to Charlie Pickett had been from his
earliest recollection. But when Aunt Martha
came in to bid him good night, the swelling tide
of emotion that he had repressed for many hours,
forced its way to his lips, and he put his arms
around her neck and, amid many sobs, he told
the story of the afternoon.</p>

<p>“I must have ’im, Aunt Martha,” he said at
last; “I must have ’em both. Some way we
must get Gran’pap to make up with ’im. I
don’t know how it’s to be done; but some way
we must do it. It’s terrible to let it go on like
this; an’ Gran’pap’s so good to me&mdash;so good.
Why won’t he forgive ’im, Aunt Martha? Why
won’t he?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, dearie. It’s his way. His
father was so before him. It’s in the blood. All
we can do, you and I, all we can do is to hope
and to pray. Your grandfather will never yield
to argument, nor to pleading. But I still have
faith to believe that some time, in some way, the
good God will bring about a reconciliation.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Aunt Martha! I shall hope for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
it, and pray for it, and work for it, too, every day
and all day until it comes.”</p>

<p>“And may it speedily come. There, now, you
are very tired; go to sleep. Try to forget everything
and go to sleep! You will feel better to-morrow.
Good night!”</p>

<p>“Good night, Auntie!”</p>

<p>But when the morning came Dannie did not
feel better. He slept late, yet he was not refreshed
by his sleep. He was still tired, and his
limbs dragged heavily as he went about the house.
And, try as he might to forget it, that scene in
the jury room the day before was ever present
in his mind, a vivid picture of what he had found&mdash;and
lost. Little by little the members of the
household gathered from his lips the complete
story of his journey through the storm. And
while Abner Pickett smiled grimly at the boy’s
pluck and will and mighty determination, since it
proved him to be every inch a Pickett, Aunt
Martha, moved by the lad’s tale of physical suffering,
and touched by the moral energy that led
him to endure it, turned her head away more
than once to hide the tears that kept swelling to
her eyes.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Gabriel came home. Of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
equity trial he could give no news except that the
evidence had been completed and a day fixed
for the argument of counsel. But of Dannie’s
journey through the storm, of his appearance in
the court room, of his testimony on the witness
stand, he never ceased to talk. For days and
weeks it formed the sole topic of his discourse.</p>

<p>“It was wuth a year’s wages,” he declared
many a time; “it was wuth a year’s wages not to
’a’ missed it. Ez ol’ Isra’l Pidgin use to say:
‘Truth is jest ez mighty an’ pervailin’ w’en it
comes f’om the lips uv a child, ez w’en it comes
f’om the mouth uv an archangel.’”</p>

<p>That night, when Dannie went to bed, his
pulse was beating rapidly, his face was flushed,
his head was very hot and heavy, and he was
troubled with a hacking cough. He did not
complain of any pain, except the soreness and
constant aching of all his joints and muscles; but
that was due, he thought, to the violent effort
necessary to force his way through the drifts the
day before. Aunt Martha saw, however, that
beyond the mere fact of physical fatigue, the boy
was ill; and she insisted upon putting him to bed
in the large guest-chamber adjoining her own
sleeping room on the ground floor, where a fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
could be kept burning on the hearth, and she
could give him constant attention by night and
day. He demurred to this arrangement at first,
but soon, through sheer weariness, he yielded;
and it was not long after his head touched the
pillow, before he was fast asleep. Later in the
night he appeared to be troubled and restless, and
turned constantly in his bed, asking frequently
for water. Aunt Martha tried to allay his fever
with some simple remedies, but she found that
her efforts were in vain. Early in the morning
she awoke Abner Pickett and told him that
Dannie was ill. He dressed himself, came in and
looked at the boy, and saw, at the first glance,
that the services of a physician were needed.</p>

<p>Before daylight Gabriel was on his way to Port
Lenox to summon Dr. Chubbuck, and at nine
o’clock the doctor came. He was short and
stout, and red in the face, and carried with him
always an air of joviality. But when he came out
from the sick room he looked grave.</p>

<p>“What is it, Doctor?” inquired Abner Pickett,
anxiously.</p>

<p>The doctor sat down by the table and unlocked
his medicine chest before replying. He was
always deliberate with his answers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’s pneumonia,” he said finally.
“One lung seems to be pretty badly involved.
I guess we’ll pull him through, though.”</p>

<p>He weighed out the medicine and divided the
powder into separate doses.</p>

<p>“Give him one every three hours.” Then he
added, “Martha’s been telling me what he did
Tuesday. What under the canopy possessed
him to paddle through that storm to Mooreville,
I can’t see. Why, he might have died of exhaustion.
As it is he&mdash;well, we’ll do what we
can for him.”</p>

<p>He turned his attention then to the compounding
of a liquid prescription.</p>

<p>“Give him a teaspoonful every hour,” he
directed, “till you get his pulse down to something
reasonable&mdash;say a hundred and twenty.
How’s the lawsuit going to come out, Abner?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, an’ I don’t much care if you’ll
only pull this boy through.”</p>

<p>“Just so. Do the best we can, of course.
Nice boy; hate to lose him. I don’t think
you’ll have any particular trouble to-night,
though, and I’ll come up in the morning again
and see how he is.”</p>

<p>When he came the next morning, he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Dannie no better. The fever was still high, and
the congestion was still spreading in the affected
lung. The next day both lungs were involved.
Then Dr. Chubbuck realized that the case was
getting critical. He gave to his task all the energy,
all the skill, all the best thought and judgment,
at his command. He was fond of the boy;
he had been fond of the boy’s father before him.
He had known Abner Pickett intimately from childhood,
and, while he respected him for his many
good and sterling qualities, he did not hesitate to
condemn his faults to his face. And, strange as
it may seem, Dr. Chubbuck was the only man
in the world, under whose condemnation Abner
Pickett would sit quietly with no show of resentment.
The old man believed in him, trusted him,
and relied on him in everything. There was only
one topic that he would not permit him to mention,
and that was the estrangement between him
and his son.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the doctor’s skilful treatment,
and Aunt Martha’s tender nursing, Dannie grew
steadily worse. He did not suffer great pain, but
he was growing constantly weaker, and there was
no abatement of the fever. He often wandered
in his mind. He thought he was again battling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
with the storm. He would cry out that it was
impossible for him to go farther through those
dreadful drifts; that he was sinking to his death
in the deep snow; and he would beg piteously for
some one to come and rescue him.</p>

<p>“There are no drifts, Dannie,” Aunt Martha
would say to him. “You are not out in the snow-storm
now; you are at home in bed; and I am sitting
here beside you; and Gran’pap is standing there
by the foot-board. You are dreaming, that is all.”</p>

<p>But by the time Dannie would turn his glassy
eyes toward the foot of the bed, Gran’pap would
not be there. He would be in the next room
wiping from his face the tears that Dannie must
not see. Hour after hour he would pace up and
down the carpeted floor, or sit silent by the fire,
waiting, in an agony of dread, for what the next
moment might bring forth. While Dannie’s life
was hanging in the balance he could neither work
nor eat nor sleep. It distressed him greatly to
hear the sick child’s constant call for water to
alleviate his thirst. They were obliged to give
it to him in small quantities, inasmuch as his
stomach, yielding to the general weakness, was
participating actively in the disease.</p>

<p>“Can’t he have somethin’, Doc?” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the old man, impatiently, “somethin’ that he can
just drink down&mdash;somethin’ that’ll satisfy him
if it ain’t but for five minutes? I can’t stan’ it to
hear him beggin’ that way all the time for water!”</p>

<p>The doctor explained why liquids taken on the
stomach in large quantities, in Dannie’s case, might
prove disastrous, and then mentioned a certain
carbonated water, put up in siphon bottles, which
he thought might be taken more freely and with
good effect.</p>

<p>“I can’t get it in Port Lenox,” he added; “but
Chamberlain at Mooreville has it. You might
send up by the stage to-morrow morning and get
some and try it.”</p>

<p>“Write down the name of it, Doctor.”</p>

<p>The doctor did so. Without another word
Abner Pickett took the slip of paper and left the
room. He hurried to the barn and summoned
Gabriel.</p>

<p>“Here,” he said, “help me to hitch up, quick!
Take the team and the light cutter. You go to
Mooreville to Chamberlain’s, as fast as the two
horses’ll draw you, an’ back again. Get three
dozen bottles of the stuff that’s written down on
this paper, an don’t waste a minute, as you hope
for Heaven!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Gabriel obeyed the order to the letter. He
saved neither the horses nor himself. At dinner
time he was back again with the effervescent
water. Abner Pickett was so pleased with the
haste made, that he asked it as a special favor
that Gabriel might go in to see Dannie.</p>

<p>“It’s Gabriel,” said Aunt Martha. “He
brought you something from Mooreville, something
to drink. Here it is in the glass. See
how it sparkles!”</p>

<p>“And may I drink it from the glass?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>She raised his head gently from the pillow and
held the tumbler to his lips. When he had
swallowed the liquid he turned his grateful eyes
on Gabriel.</p>

<p>“Thank you!” he said. “Thank you, very
much. That&mdash;was so good&mdash;you were always&mdash;doing
nice things for me&mdash;Gabriel.”</p>

<p>And Gabriel, not daring to trust himself to
reply, turned and left the room. When he was
able to control his voice, he said to Abner
Pickett:&mdash;</p>

<p>“They tell me he thinks he’s in the drifts
a-goin’ from the poor-house to Mooreville, an’
that the snow’s a-smotherin’ ’im. You tell ’im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the road’s all clear now. Tell ’im I went by
there a-flyin’. Tell ’im a baby could walk
through them drifts now without any help.
Maybe it’ll sort o’ relieve ’is mind on that
p’int.”</p>

<p>The old man looked up at him grimly:
“Gabriel, you’re a&mdash;God bless you, Gabriel!
Get to your dinner.”</p>

<p>But Dannie’s dreams were not all of his journey
through the storm. He often thought he
was with his father. And always some one came
between them and forced them apart and compelled
him to go away. It was pitiful at these
times to look upon his distress. It required all
of Aunt Martha’s power of persuasion to induce
him to believe that his imaginings were not realities.
And if, at last, he was made to realize that
his father was not with him, he would turn his
head wearily on his pillow and sigh with disappointment.
One morning Aunt Martha called
the doctor aside and spoke to him very earnestly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied; “yes, certainly. He must
do it.”</p>

<p>He went out into the sitting room where Abner
Pickett was pacing up and down the floor.</p>

<p>“Abner,” he said, “I’ve been used to expressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
my mind to you pretty freely, and I’m
going to do it now. I don’t know much about
the quarrel between you and Charlie, and I don’t
want to know. I don’t know which of you is to
blame, and I don’t care. But, granted the fault
is all Charlie’s, he has, nevertheless, some rights
as a father, which you, as a man, are bound to
respect. And one of them is to know that his
child is desperately ill, and to have the opportunity
to come, if he wants to, and look on the
boy’s face while there’s life in it. Now, that’s
all. If you don’t know where to find him,
Martha does.”</p>

<p>Abner Pickett stopped in his monotonous walk
and looked at the doctor for a full minute from
out his haggard eyes. In that minute he went
over the entire past, he considered the terrible
present, he looked into the dark future. Then
he said simply:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Tell Martha to send for him.”</p>

<p>At midnight Charlie Pickett came home. He
entered by the kitchen door, as in the old days,
and passed on into the sitting room. His father
was there, seated by the fire, gazing steadfastly on
the burning coals.</p>

<p>“Father, I’ve come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man did not answer him. He did not
even lift his eyes from the blazing logs. But
whether his silence was due to the old feud and
stubbornness, or whether he dared not trust himself
to reply, Charlie did not know.</p>

<p>“Father,” he said again, “I’ve come&mdash;to see
Dannie.”</p>

<p>Still the old man did not answer, but he motioned
with his head toward the inner room, and
then turned again to the fire. So Charlie entered
the room where his sick child lay. Aunt Martha
met him at the threshold and kissed the cheek he
bent down to her. Dannie was talking softly in
his delirium, in the broken sentences that tell of
rapid respiration. He thought he was walking
up the gap in the moonlight, with his father, the
engineer.</p>

<p>“It’s most morning now,” he murmured; “I&mdash;must
hurry home. Gran’pap&mdash;don’t know&mdash;I’m
out. Yes, it is; it’s a&mdash;beautiful curve,
beautiful. That’s my&mdash;mother’s grave there&mdash;you
know. Gran’pap wouldn’t&mdash;have a stake
there&mdash;for worlds&mdash;an’ worlds. You’re so good&mdash;to
go&mdash;around it. That’s because&mdash;you’re
my father. Are you&mdash;my father? I’m so glad.
Don’t hold me&mdash;quite so tight&mdash;father; it hurts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
me&mdash;here in my side&mdash;so. That’s better.
Who’s that&mdash;pulling you away? Don’t go,
father,&mdash;don’t go. Oh, don’t go!”</p>

<p>“No, Dannie; I’ll not go. I’m here now to
stay until you get well.”</p>

<p>Dannie opened his eyes wearily, and saw his
father’s face bent over him. He did not seem
surprised, only gratified. He reached out both
his hot hands and grasped the strong cool hand
of his father.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad&mdash;you’re going&mdash;to stay,” he
said; “I want you&mdash;all the time. I lost you&mdash;last
night&mdash;in the snow. I called&mdash;and called&mdash;but
you didn’t&mdash;hear me. I’m so glad&mdash;you’re
here again&mdash;so glad&mdash;so glad!”</p>

<p>With his father’s hand in his he fell asleep, and
on his face, for the first time during his illness,
there was an expression of supreme content.</p>

<p>When Dr. Chubbuck left the sick-room the
next morning no one asked him how his patient
was; the look on his face forestalled that question.
He sent his team and driver back to Port
Lenox. “I shall not leave here to-day,” he
said; “the boy needs me.”</p>

<p>So he watched hour after hour at Dannie’s bedside,
fighting, with every resource of skill and experience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
against what seemed, to all, to be the
inevitable end. At midnight the crisis came.
They all knew it was on. No one in the house
went to bed. Gabriel, in the kitchen hallway,
stood ready for instant service, as he had stood for
days&mdash;and nights. Even Max, lying by the
sitting-room fire, never took his sleepless eyes
from the door that led to Dannie’s room. The
hush that tells of the near approach of man’s last
enemy lay heavy on the house and all its inmates.
There came a time when even those who were
nearest and dearest to the sick boy could no
longer bear the strain of watching at his bedside.
The sudden fall of temperature, predicted by the
doctor, had come, bringing its ghastly pallor, its
relaxed muscles, its vivid signs of physical collapse;
and Abner Pickett and his son, both unable
to continue looking on the unequal struggle,
had left the room.</p>

<p>Since Charlie’s arrival, the night before, no
word had passed between them. The old man
maintained a studied silence that said as plainly
as words could have expressed it that he did not
intend to permit Dannie’s desperate illness to
be made the occasion for a reconciliation. And
Charlie, looking now and again at the haggard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and anxious, yet determined, face of his father,
knew that even Dannie’s death would not suffice
to bridge the awful gulf of estrangement. They
sat there now, in the outer room, the old man,
with his chin in his hands, staring into the fire,
and Charlie resting his head on the table and
waiting for the end; and the unhappy, the unholy
power of stubborn pride and self-will and
resentment holding them aloof from each other,
while, under their very eyes, death was grappling
for a life that either would have given his own to
save.</p>

<p>In the midst of their reverie they became suddenly
aware that Dr. Chubbuck was standing in
the doorway of the sick-room, ready to speak to
them. Both men felt that the end was approaching,
or had already come, and they rose reverently
to their feet. The doctor advanced a few steps
into the room, and spoke low, but distinctly:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, the crisis has passed. The temperature
has risen to normal, and the patient has
just fallen into a restful sleep. I believe he will
live.”</p>

<p>Then he turned and went back into Dannie’s
room. For a moment both men stood as if
stunned. Instinctively they gazed into each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
other’s faces. Then Abner Pickett, with great
strides, crossed the room to where Charlie
stood. He put a trembling hand on each of
his son’s stalwart shoulders, and looked straight
into his clear blue eyes.</p>

<p>“My son,” he said, <a href="#image01">“I have been to blame.”</a></p>

<p>And Charlie, putting his arm caressingly about
the old man’s neck, replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Father, for all that I have done against your
wish and will, forgive me!”</p>

<p>That was all. No more words were necessary.
The reconciliation was complete. That which
even Dannie’s death could not have brought
about was accomplished in one instant by the
announcement that he would live. Joy will
sometimes crush the heart that sorrow cannot
touch.</p>

<p>A minute later, when Aunt Martha was about
to cross the room hurriedly on some errand of
mercy, she stopped suddenly, astounded at the
sight that greeted her. But she grasped at once
the beautiful meaning of it all, and raising her
eyes devoutly toward heaven, she gently murmured:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Thanks be to God, who giveth us the
victory!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>When Gabriel learned that Dannie would live,
his joy knew no bounds; and when, in addition
to that, he was told that Abner Pickett had
become reconciled with his son, he could find
but one mode of expressing his deep exultation.
He plunged through the trackless fields and up
the steep, snow-covered side of the ridge till he
reached the topmost peak above the glen; and
there, where no sound that he could make would
disturb the sufferer, facing alternately to the bright
east and the clear west, he blew blast after blast
on his faithful horn; blast after blast, with bulging
cheeks and reddening face and pounding heart,
till it seemed as though the echoes of the hill and
glen would tire of answering.</p>

<p>But Dannie was not yet wholly out of danger.
His convalescence was very slow. There were
still days of disappointment and nights of anxiety.
He never seemed to wonder at his father’s presence,
although it was plain that he rejoiced in it.
It was thought best not to tell him at once of the
reconciliation between Abner Pickett and his son.
It was necessary to avoid every pretext for undue
excitement; and the two men were never in his
room together after that terrible night when the
crisis was passed; never until they were sure he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
would be able to bear the news. It was one day
when he was sitting propped up in bed, looking
out over the snow-clad hills, that they came in
quietly and stood together at his side before he
was aware of their presence. He looked wonderingly
from one to the other; but there was a
smile on the face of each, and then Charlie laid
his arm gently about the old man’s shoulders.</p>

<p>“Is it true?” asked Dannie, flushing with joy
and pride as he looked.</p>

<p>“It is true,” said Abner Pickett.</p>

<p>“And, please God, it will stay true,” added
Charlie.</p>

<p>Swift tears sprang into Dannie’s eyes, and he
put a thin, weak arm around each of their necks,
and drew their faces down to his and kissed them.
In the doorway Gabriel stood with a newspaper
in his hand endeavoring to attract attention.
When at last the two men turned toward him, he
exclaimed in a loud and exultant whisper:&mdash;</p>

<p>“We’ve won it.”</p>

<p>“Won what?” asked Charlie.</p>

<p>“The lawsuit. It’s all here in the paper.”</p>

<p>He held up the page so that they could read
the head-lines.</p>

<p>“Judge Moore Continues the Injunction against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the D. V. &amp; E. and Makes it Permanent. Holds
that the Adoption of the Pickett’s Gap Route by
the Board of Directors of the T. &amp; W. was First

Right of Way through Pickett’s Graveyard is
Invalid, having been Obtained through a Misunderstanding
of Facts. Concludes that the D. V.
&amp; E. Company has no Right to Lay its Tracks
in the Gap or the Graveyard.”</p>

<p>“I’m so glad!” exclaimed Dannie.</p>

<p>“I knowed we’d knock ’em out in the fust
round,” said Gabriel. “Ez ol’ Isra’l Pidgin use
to say, ‘It ain’t ev’ry&mdash;’”</p>

<p>“Gabriel,” interrupted the old man, with a
smile on his face that told of the joy in his heart
even though he gave voice to the old familiar
words, “Gabriel, you’re a fool.”</p>

It is well told, with plenty of action, admirably illustrated with
